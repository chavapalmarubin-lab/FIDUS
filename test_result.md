# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Integrate a fully integrated CRM system for FIDUS extending the existing portal. The CRM must: manage client onboarding with digital KYC/AML, track investor allocations across four funds (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automate capital flows (subscriptions, redemptions, distributions), and generate real-time dashboards for AUM, NAV, and performance. Include Python MetaQuotes MT4/MT5 integration for client activity monitoring in Admin portal. Focus on core features first."

Tested all Gmail OAuth endpoints successfully: (1) GET /api/gmail/auth-url generates proper OAuth authorization URL with correct client ID (909926639154-cjtnt3urluctt1q90gri3rtj37vbim6h.apps.googleusercontent.com), proper Google OAuth parameters, and unique state parameters for security. (2) POST /api/gmail/authenticate properly detects missing credentials and provides OAuth flow instructions with correct redirect to auth-url endpoint. (3) GET /api/gmail/oauth-callback validates parameters and handles OAuth flow appropriately with proper error handling for invalid states and missing parameters. All endpoints have proper error handling and security measures including CSRF protection via state parameter validation. OAuth flow is correctly implemented for web application flow."

Detailed analysis of user-reported \"not connecting\" issue reveals backend is functioning correctly: (1) POST /api/gmail/authenticate returns proper 200 response with success:false, action:'redirect_to_oauth', and correct auth_url_endpoint '/api/gmail/auth-url' when no credentials exist. (2) GET /api/gmail/auth-url generates valid Google OAuth URL with all correct parameters: client_id, scope (gmail.send), redirect_uri, state, response_type=code, access_type=offline. URL format verified: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth with proper encoding. (3) OAuth callback endpoint properly validates required parameters (code, state) with 422 errors for missing params and 400/500 for invalid state (CSRF protection working). (4) State management working correctly - unique states generated, invalid states rejected. (5) Google OAuth integration confirmed - dummy auth codes properly rejected by Google servers. DIAGNOSIS: Backend OAuth implementation is PERFECT. User's \"not connecting\" issue despite 200 responses indicates FRONTEND problem - likely JavaScript not properly handling OAuth flow, not redirecting to authorization_url, or not processing OAuth responses correctly. Backend requires no fixes."
