## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### Issue #1: MT5 Trades/Deals NOT Syncing ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Symptom:**
- Broker rebates showing $450 (incorrect)
- Frontend calculation based on stale data
- Last deal sync: October 19 (5 days ago)

**Root Cause:**
- VPS sync service only syncs **account balances**
- Does NOT sync **deals/trades history**
- MongoDB `mt5_deals_history` collection has 2,739 deals but last update was Oct 19
- VPS Bridge HAS current trades (`/api/mt5/account/{id}/trades` returns 20 trades)
- Backend never fetches them

**Impact:**
- **CRITICAL**: Financial calculations wrong
- **Affected:** ALL clients with active trading
- **Data Type:** Rebates, performance fees, trading analytics
- **Client Trust:** SEVERE - showing incorrect money calculations

**Expected Behavior:**
1. VPS has live MT5 deals
2. Backend should sync deals every 5 minutes (like balances)
3. MongoDB `mt5_deals_history` should be current (<5 min old)
4. Rebates calculated from current volume
5. Frontend shows accurate rebates

**Current Behavior:**
1. ✅ VPS has live MT5 deals
2. ❌ Backend does NOT sync deals
3. ❌ MongoDB has stale deals (5 days old)
4. ❌ Rebates calculated from old volume
5. ❌ Frontend shows wrong rebates ($450 instead of correct amount)

**Correct Rebates Calculation:**
```python
# Get deals from last 30 days
deals = db.mt5_deals_history.find({
    'time': {'$gte': start_date, '$lte': end_date},
    'type': {'$in': [0, 1]}  # Buy/Sell only
})

# Calculate volume
total_volume = sum(deal['volume'] for deal in deals)

# Calculate rebates
total_rebates = total_volume * 5.05  # $5.05 per lot

# Currently showing: $450
# Should be: $XXX (need to calculate from current VPS data)
```

**Fix Required:**
1. Add deals/trades sync to VPS sync service
2. Fetch from `/api/mt5/account/{id}/trades` for each account
3. Update `mt5_deals_history` collection
4. Run every 5 minutes (same as balance sync)

**Files to Modify:**
- `/app/backend/vps_sync_service.py` - Add trades sync
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Update automatic_vps_sync() to include trades

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours (implement + test)

**Dependencies:** None (VPS API already has trades endpoint)

---

### Issue #2: Rebate Transactions Not Recording ⚠️ HIGH

**Symptom:**
- `rebate_transactions` collection has only 1 entry
- Amount: $0
- Last update: October 13

**Root Cause:**
- Rebate calculation service exists but NOT running automatically
- Only calculates on manual API call
- Never stores transactions in `rebate_transactions` collection

**Impact:**
- **HIGH**: No audit trail of rebates
- **Affected:** Financial reporting, client statements
- **Data Type:** Historical rebate records

**Fix Required:**
1. Schedule rebate calculation to run monthly
2. Store results in `rebate_transactions` collection
3. Add to automatic sync schedule

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

### Issue #3: Data Freshness Monitoring Not Automated ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Symptom:**
- No automatic alerts when data goes stale
- Manual checking required

**Root Cause:**
- Monitoring tool exists (`monitor_mt5_sync.py`)
- But not running continuously
- No alerts configured

**Impact:**
- **MEDIUM**: Issues discovered late
- **Affected:** System reliability, response time

**Fix Required:**
1. Set up continuous monitoring
2. Add email/log alerts for stale data
3. Add health check endpoint

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

---

### Issue #4: No Automatic Trades Validation ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Symptom:**
- No validation that synced trades match MT5

**Root Cause:**
- No comparison between VPS trades and MongoDB
- Could sync wrong data without detection

**Impact:**
- **MEDIUM**: Potential data integrity issues
- **Affected:** All financial calculations based on trades

**Fix Required:**
1. Add trade count validation
2. Compare latest trade timestamps
3. Alert on mismatches

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours
