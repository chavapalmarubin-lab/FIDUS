## 🚨 AUTO-HEALING WORKFLOW

### Detection Phase (0-30 seconds)

**What's Monitored:**
1. MT5 Terminal connection status (`trade_allowed: false`)
2. Account balance validation (all accounts = $0)
3. MT5 Bridge health endpoint response
4. Sync success rate (<20% triggers alert)

**Detection Frequency:**
- Every 2 minutes via `mt5_auto_sync_service.py`
- Continuous health monitoring via watchdog

### Alert Phase (30-45 seconds)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ **Email Alert Sent**
   - To: chavapalmarubin@gmail.com
   - Subject: "🚨 FIDUS MT5 CRITICAL ALERT"
   - Content: Issue description + timestamp
   
2. ✅ **In-App Notification**
   - System Health Dashboard updated
   - Red status indicator shown
   - Alert details logged

3. ✅ **Log Entry**
   ```
   CRITICAL: MT5 Terminal NOT CONNECTED to broker - initiating auto-restart
   ```

### Recovery Phase (45 seconds - 5 minutes)

**Automatic Recovery Steps:**

1. **GitHub Actions Trigger** (45-60 seconds)
   ```python
   # Backend triggers repository_dispatch event
   POST https://api.github.com/repos/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/dispatches
   {
     "event_type": "mt5-full-restart",
     "client_payload": {
       "trigger": "auto_sync_service",
       "reason": "MT5 Terminal disconnected",
       "timestamp": "2025-10-31T11:26:00Z"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow Execution** (1-2 minutes)
   - Workflow: `mt5-full-restart.yml`
   - Action: POST to VPS restart endpoint
   - VPS receives restart command

3. **MT5 Terminal Restart** (2-3 minutes)
   - All 7 MT5 accounts relogin
   - Terminal reconnects to broker
   - Bridge service refreshes cache

4. **Verification** (4-5 minutes)
   - Backend re-checks MT5 Bridge health
   - Validates all 7 accounts have balances
   - Confirms `trade_allowed: true`
   - Sends recovery confirmation email

### Success Confirmation

**Email Notification:**
```
✅ MT5 Bridge automatically recovered
Recovery method: GitHub Actions workflow restart
Recovery time: 4 minutes 23 seconds
All 7 accounts online with live balances
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Auto-Healing Fails

**Symptom:** Received alert but system still down after 10 minutes

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/actions
   - Look for failed workflow runs
   - Review error logs

2. Verify GITHUB_TOKEN:
   - Render Dashboard → Environment → `GITHUB_TOKEN` exists
   - Token has `repo` and `workflow` scopes
   - Token is not expired

3. Check VPS Status:
   - Can you access http://92.118.45.135:8000/api/mt5/bridge/health ?
   - Is VPS powered on?
   - Is network accessible?

4. Manual Recovery:
   - SSH to VPS: `ssh trader@92.118.45.135`
   - Check Task Scheduler for MT5 Bridge service
   - Manually restart: `Restart-Service "MT5 Bridge"`

### If No Alerts Received

**Symptom:** System down but no email received

**Check:**
1. **SMTP Configuration**
   - `SMTP_USERNAME` set in Render
   - `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD` set in Render
   - `ALERT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` = chavapalmarubin@gmail.com

2. **Email Provider**
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify Gmail app password is valid
   - Test with: Send test alert from System Health Dashboard

3. **Backend Logs**
   ```
   Look for: "✅ Email alert sent to chavapalmarubin@gmail.com"
   If missing: Alert system failed to send
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: GitHub Actions returns HTTP 422**
- **Cause:** Invalid repository_dispatch payload
- **Fix:** Verify `event_type: "mt5-full-restart"` matches workflow

**Issue 2: GITHUB_TOKEN not found**
- **Cause:** Render didn't redeploy after adding token
- **Fix:** Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit

**Issue 3: MT5 Terminal won't restart**
- **Cause:** VPS endpoint `/api/system/full-restart` doesn't exist
- **Fix:** Update MT5 Bridge on VPS with restart endpoint
