# VPS Migration - October 2025

**Migration Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed Successfully  
**Total Downtime:** ~6 hours

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Successfully migrated FIDUS MT5 Bridge infrastructure from problematic old VPS to new, stable ForexVPS server. All 7 MT5 accounts are now syncing correctly with zero data loss.

---

## üéØ Why We Migrated

### Critical Issues on Old VPS (217.197.163.11)

#### 1. Hidden Windows Service Conflict ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Problem:** A hidden Windows service called "MT5Bridge" was auto-restarting the WRONG Python file
- **Impact:** All API endpoints returned 404 errors
- **Service showed:** "FIDUS MT5 Bridge Service" instead of "FIDUS MT5 Bridge API"
- **Attempts to fix:** Multiple automated deployments via GitHub Actions failed
- **Result:** Service conflicts could not be resolved remotely

#### 2. GitHub Actions Connection Blocked üö´
- **Problem:** SSH access was blocked on old VPS
- **Impact:** Could not deploy fixes remotely via CI/CD
- **Workaround:** Had to create manual batch scripts for user to run
- **Result:** Required constant manual intervention, defeating automation purpose

#### 3. Unable to Implement Auto-Healing üîß
**We were trying to implement:**
- MT5 Watchdog monitoring every 60 seconds
- Auto-healing when MT5 fails (after 3 consecutive failures)
- Intelligent alerting (only notify when auto-fix fails)
- GitHub Actions emergency deployment workflow

**But were blocked because:**
- 404 errors prevented proper health monitoring
- Hidden service kept interfering with deployments
- No remote access for automation workflows

#### 4. MongoDB Connection Issues üóÑÔ∏è
- **Problem:** Critical typo in cluster name (`ylp9be2` instead of `y1p9be2`)
- **Impact:** MT5 Bridge couldn't connect to database for extended period
- **Discovery:** Found after extensive debugging
- **Fix:** Required manual PowerShell script execution by user

# NEW:
MT5_BRIDGE_URL="http://92.118.45.135:8000"
```

### GitHub Secrets
```yaml
# Updated in GitHub repository secrets:
VPS_HOST: 92.118.45.135
VPS_PORT: 42014
VPS_USERNAME: trader
VPS_PASSWORD: [secured]
```

### MongoDB Atlas Network Access
**Added:**
- 92.118.45.135/32 (NEW VPS - FIDUS MT5 Bridge)

**Removed:**
- 217.197.163.11/32 (OLD VPS - Deprecated)

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- `deploy-mt5-bridge-emergency-ps.yml` - Emergency restart workflow
- All VPS-related workflows updated with new IP and port

### Codebase References
**Files Updated:**
- `/app/backend/.env` - MT5_BRIDGE_URL

## üêõ Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: MongoDB Cluster Name Typo
**Problem:**
```
Cluster name: ylp9be2 (WRONG - letter L)
Should be: y1p9be2 (CORRECT - number 1)
```

**Impact:** MT5 Bridge couldn't connect to MongoDB for several hours

**Resolution:**
1. Created PowerShell script `fix-mongodb-cluster.ps1`
2. User executed script on VPS
3. Service restarted with correct cluster name
4. Connection successful

### Issue 2: Missing API Routes
**Problem:** `/api/mt5/accounts` endpoint returned 404 error

**Impact:** Frontend couldn't fetch MT5 account list

**Resolution:**
1. Identified missing route in `vps/mt5_bridge_api_service.py`
2. Added complete `/api/mt5/accounts` endpoint
3. Deployed via GitHub Actions
4. Endpoint now working correctly

### Issue 3: GitHub Token Authentication
**Problem:** Auto-healing couldn't trigger GitHub workflows

**Impact:** Watchdog could monitor but not auto-recover

**Resolution:**
1. Generated GitHub Personal Access Token with `workflow` and `repo` scopes
2. Added `GITHUB_TOKEN` to backend `.env`
3. Watchdog now fully operational with auto-healing

---

## üìà Post-Migration Improvements

**Now Operational:**
- MT5 Watchdog monitors health every 60 seconds
- Auto-healing triggers after 3 consecutive failures
- GitHub Actions workflow restarts service automatically
- Email alerts only when auto-healing fails
- **Expected impact:** 90% of issues auto-resolve within 3-5 minutes

### 2. Clean Service Environment ‚úÖ
**Benefits:**
- No hidden service conflicts
- Proper service auto-start configuration
- Clean deployment process
- Remote access for automation

### 3. Improved Monitoring ‚úÖ
**New Capabilities:**
- Real-time watchdog status API
- Health check endpoints fully operational
- Comprehensive logging
- Alert email system configured

### 4. Better Infrastructure ‚úÖ
**Advantages:**
- ForexVPS optimized for trading applications
- Better network stability
- Proper SSH/RDP access for remote management
- Clear documentation and procedures

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Verify Credentials Carefully
**Issue:** MongoDB cluster name typo (`ylp9be2` vs `y1p9be2`)  
**Lesson:** Double-check all connection strings, especially when they contain similar-looking characters (1 vs l, 0 vs O)  
**Prevention:** Use environment variable validation scripts

### 2. Test MongoDB Connection Before Full Migration
**Issue:** Spent hours debugging connectivity after migration  
**Lesson:** Should have tested MongoDB connection first before deploying full service  
**Prevention:** Create pre-migration checklist with connection tests

### 3. Document Hidden Services
**Issue:** Hidden Windows service on old VPS caused persistent conflicts  
**Lesson:** Thoroughly document all auto-start services and scheduled tasks  
**Prevention:** Use `Get-ScheduledTask` and `Get-Service` to inventory before deployment

### 4. Use Batch Files Instead of Long PowerShell Commands
**Issue:** GitHub Actions SSH couldn't execute long PowerShell commands  
**Lesson:** Long scripts via SSH are unreliable on Windows  
**Prevention:** Always create batch files for VPS automation

### 5. Fresh Start Sometimes Better Than Debugging
**Issue:** Spent days debugging old VPS conflicts  
**Lesson:** Migration to fresh VPS resolved all issues immediately  
**Prevention:** Evaluate if fresh deployment is faster than fixing legacy issues
