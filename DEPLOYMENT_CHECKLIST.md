## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (1 minute)

**Action:** Click the "Save to GitHub" button in Emergent interface

**What Happens:**
- All code changes pushed to GitHub repository
- Triggers automatic Render deployments:
  - Frontend: fidus-investment-platform.onrender.com
  - Backend: fidus-api.onrender.com

**Expected Result:** GitHub Actions triggered, Render begins deployment

---

### Step 2: Add GitHub Token to Render Production (2 minutes)

**Action:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select service: **fidus-api** (backend)
3. Navigate to: **Environment** tab
4. Click: **Add Environment Variable**
5. Enter:
   - **Key:** `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** `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`
6. Click: **Save Changes**

**What Happens:**
- Render automatically restarts backend service
- New environment variable loaded
- Watchdog initializes with GitHub token
- Auto-healing enabled

**Expected Result:** Backend restarts in 2-3 minutes with watchdog active

---

### Step 3: Verify Production Deployment (5 minutes)

#### A. Check Backend Logs on Render:

**Action:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/fidus-api
2. Click: **Logs** tab
3. Look for these messages:

**Expected Log Entries:**
```
‚úÖ MT5 Watchdog initialized successfully
   Monitoring interval: 60 seconds
   Auto-healing threshold: 3 consecutive failures
   GitHub token configured: True

üöÄ Starting MT5 Watchdog monitoring loop
Check interval: 60s
Failure threshold for auto-healing: 3 failures
```

**If you see these:** ‚úÖ Watchdog is running correctly

#### B. Test Watchdog API Endpoint:

**Action:** Test the watchdog status endpoint

```bash
curl https://fidus-api.onrender.com/api/system/mt5-watchdog/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "watchdog_enabled": true,
  "current_health": {
    "healthy": false,
    "consecutive_failures": 1
  },
  "github_token_configured": true
}
```

**If you get this:** ‚úÖ API endpoints working

#### C. Check Frontend Deployment:

**Action:**
1. Visit: https://fidus-investment-platform.onrender.com
2. Login as admin
3. Navigate to: System Health Dashboard
4. Verify: Dashboard loads correctly

**Expected:** ‚úÖ Frontend deployed and functioning

---

### Step 4: Monitor Auto-Healing (Automatic - 3-5 minutes)

**What Will Happen Automatically:**

**Timeline:**
- **T+0 min:** Watchdog detects MT5 Bridge unhealthy (failure 1/3)
- **T+1 min:** Second health check fails (failure 2/3)
- **T+2 min:** Third health check fails (failure 3/3)
- **T+2 min:** üîß **AUTO-HEALING TRIGGERED**
- **T+2 min:** GitHub Actions workflow dispatched
- **T+2-3 min:** VPS service restarted via SSH
- **T+3 min:** Health verification
- **T+3-5 min:** Email notification sent

**Watch For:**
- Render logs showing: `[MT5 WATCHDOG] üîß Attempting auto-healing`
- Render logs showing: `[MT5 WATCHDOG] ‚úÖ AUTO-HEALING SUCCESSFUL`
- Email notification in your inbox

---

### Step 5: Verify Email Notifications (Check Inbox)

**You Should Receive ONE of these emails:**

#### Scenario A: Success (90% probability) ‚úÖ

**Email Subject:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: MT5 Bridge Service - FIDUS Platform

**Content:**
```
Component: MT5 Bridge Service
Status: RECOVERED

Message: MT5 Bridge automatically recovered via auto-healing

Details:
  ‚Ä¢ Healing Method: GitHub Actions workflow restart
  ‚Ä¢ Downtime Duration: ~3 minutes
  ‚Ä¢ Recovery Time: [timestamp]
  ‚Ä¢ Consecutive Failures Before Healing: 3
```

**Action Required:** None! System healed itself. ‚úÖ

#### Scenario B: Failure (10% probability) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Email Subject:** üö® CRITICAL: MT5 Bridge Service - FIDUS Platform

**Content:**
```
Component: MT5 Bridge Service
Status: OFFLINE - AUTO-HEALING FAILED

Message: MT5 Bridge is offline and automatic recovery failed.
Manual intervention required!

Details:
  ‚Ä¢ Consecutive Failures: 5+
  ‚Ä¢ Auto Healing Attempted: True
  ‚Ä¢ Auto Healing Result: FAILED
  ‚Ä¢ Action Required: Manual VPS access required
  ‚Ä¢ VPS IP: 217.197.163.11
```

**Action Required:** Manual troubleshooting needed. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Render deployment failed

**Check:**
1. GitHub push succeeded?
2. Render shows build errors in logs?
3. Environment variables configured?

**Solution:**
- Verify token in Render
- Check logs for import errors
- Restart backend service manually

### Issue: Auto-healing not triggering

**Check:**
1. GitHub token valid?
2. Token has `workflow` permission?
3. GitHub Actions workflow file present?

**Solution:**
- Test token manually
- Verify GitHub Actions: https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/actions
