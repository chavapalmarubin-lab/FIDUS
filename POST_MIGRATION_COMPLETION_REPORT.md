## 🎓 NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL - LOW PRIORITY)

### 1. MongoDB Atlas Cleanup
- Remove old VPS IP (217.197.163.11) from network access
- Verify if Kubernetes IP (34.56.54.64) is still needed
- Keep only: NEW VPS (92.118.45.135) and Render backend IPs

### 2. GitHub Secrets Verification
Verify these secrets are set correctly:
- `VPS_HOST` = 92.118.45.135
- `VPS_PORT` = 42014
- `VPS_USERNAME` = trader
- `VPS_PASSWORD` = [your VPS password]

### 3. Historical Documentation Cleanup
If desired, update remaining 152 old VPS references in:
- `/app/docs/` historical guides
- `/app/VPS_*` migration documents
- `/app/MT5_*` testing documents

**Note:** These are non-critical and can be left as historical reference.
