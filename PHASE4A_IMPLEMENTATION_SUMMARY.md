# Phase 4A: Deal History Collection - Implementation Complete (Days 1 & 2)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Implemented

### Day 1: VPS Bridge Enhancement ✅

1. **Enhanced VPS Bridge Script**
   - File: `/app/mt5_bridge_service/mt5_bridge_service_with_deals.py`
   - New Features:
     * `collect_deals()` - Fetch deal history using `mt5.history_deals_get()`
     * `backfill_deal_history()` - One-time 90-day historical backfill
     * `sync_daily_deals()` - Daily incremental sync (last 24 hours)
     * `sync_deals_to_mongodb()` - Bulk upsert to MongoDB
     * Automatic index creation for optimal query performance
   
2. **MongoDB Schema**
   - Collection: `mt5_deals_history`
   - Fields: ticket, order, time, type, entry, symbol, volume, price, profit, commission, swap, position_id, magic, comment, external_id, account_number
   - Indexes: account_number, time, type, symbol, compound (account_number + time), unique ticket
   - Estimated Storage: ~1.75 MB initial (3500 deals), ~3-15 MB annual

3. **Deployment Guide**
   - File: `/app/PHASE4A_VPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Complete step-by-step instructions for Chava
   - Includes troubleshooting, rollback procedure, verification steps
   - Manual testing procedure before scheduling

### Day 2: Backend API Development ✅

1. **MT5 Deals Service**
   - File: `/app/backend/services/mt5_deals_service.py`
   - 8 Methods:
     * `get_deals()` - Retrieve deals with filters
     * `get_deals_summary()` - Aggregated statistics
     * `calculate_rebates()` - Volume × $5.05 per lot
     * `get_manager_performance()` - Attribution by magic number
     * `get_balance_operations()` - Cash flow tracking
     * `get_daily_pnl()` - Daily P&L for equity curves
     * Helper methods for date parsing and classification

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Added 6 new endpoints to `/app/backend/server.py`:
     * `GET /api/mt5/deals` - Deal history with filters
     * `GET /api/mt5/deals/summary` - Aggregated stats
     * `GET /api/mt5/rebates` - Rebate calculations
     * `GET /api/mt5/analytics/performance` - Manager performance
     * `GET /api/mt5/balance-operations` - Balance operations
     * `GET /api/mt5/daily-pnl` - Daily P&L data

3. **API Documentation**
   - File: `/app/PHASE4A_BACKEND_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
   - Complete endpoint reference
   - Query parameters, response formats
   - Example usage (curl, Python, JavaScript)

## Technical Details

### Deal Data Structure

```javascript
{
  "ticket": 12345678,           // Unique deal ID
  "order": 87654321,            // Related order
  "time": "2025-01-15T14:30Z",  // Execution time
  "type": 0,                    // 0=buy, 1=sell, 2=balance
  "entry": 1,                   // 0=in, 1=out
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "volume": 1.5,                // Lots (CRITICAL for rebates)
  "price": 1.0850,
  "profit": 125.50,             // CRITICAL for analytics
  "commission": -7.50,          // CRITICAL for rebates
  "swap": -2.30,
  "position_id": 45678,
  "magic": 100234,              // Manager attribution
  "comment": "Profit withdrawal", // Transfer classification
  "account_number": 886557,
  "account_name": "Main Balance Account",
  "fund_type": "BALANCE"
}
```

### Sync Schedule

- **Account Data**: Every 5 minutes (existing)
- **Deal History**:
  * Initial backfill: 90 days on first run
  * Daily sync: Every 24 hours (last 24 hours of deals)
  * Upsert strategy: No duplicates, updates existing deals

### Query Performance

- Indexes on high-cardinality fields: `account_number`, `time`, `symbol`
- Compound index for time-series queries: `(account_number, time)`
- Unique index on `ticket` prevents duplicates
- Expected query time: <100ms for filtered queries, <1s for aggregations

- [ ] Frontend testing via automated agent
- [ ] End-to-end data flow verification
- [ ] Performance testing (query speed, data freshness)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
- VPS: Restore `mt5_bridge_service_dynamic.backup`
- Backend: Revert server.py changes (git)
- MongoDB: Collection drop if needed: `db.mt5_deals_history.drop()`

### Monitoring
- VPS logs: `C:\mt5_bridge_service\mt5_bridge_with_deals.log`
- Backend logs: `/var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log`
- MongoDB: Check collection size and document count daily

---

## Performance Optimization

### Current Implementation
- Bulk upsert for deals (efficient MongoDB writes)
- Indexed queries for fast reads
- Daily sync to minimize data transfer
- Limit parameter on queries to prevent overload

### Future Optimizations (if needed)
- Pagination for large result sets
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Aggregation result caching
- Background task for heavy computations

---

**Phase 4A Status**: Days 1 & 2 COMPLETE ✅

**Ready For**:
- VPS deployment by Chava
