# MT5 Auto-Healing System - Deployment Fix Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING

---

## üéØ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **Problem 1: GitHub Actions 422 Error**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Removed `reason` input parameter from workflow
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Updated watchdog to not send `reason` in dispatch payload
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Logs show 204 response (success) instead of 422

### **Problem 2: GitHub Actions Workflow Failing**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Upgraded `appleboy/ssh-action` from `@master` to `@v1.0.0`
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Added `script_stop: false` to prevent premature termination
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Increased timeouts (300s SSH, 10m command timeout)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Added debug mode for better error visibility
- ‚úÖ **CREATED** - New PowerShell-based workflow for better Windows compatibility

### **Problem 3: SMTP Email Alerts**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - SMTP credentials are now in Render (visible in latest logs)
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Email alerts are being sent successfully

## üìÅ **FILES CREATED/MODIFIED**

### **New Files:**
1. `.github/workflows/diagnose-vps.yml`
   - **Purpose:** Diagnose SSH and VPS connectivity issues
   - **Usage:** Manual trigger from GitHub Actions

2. `.github/workflows/deploy-mt5-bridge-emergency-ps.yml`
   - **Purpose:** PowerShell-based emergency deployment (more reliable for Windows)
   - **Usage:** Triggered by watchdog or manually

### **Modified Files:**
1. `.github/workflows/deploy-mt5-bridge-emergency.yml`
   - Upgraded SSH action version
   - Added better timeouts and error handling

2. `backend/mt5_watchdog.py`
   - Removed `reason` parameter from GitHub dispatch (line 234)
   - Changed to use PowerShell workflow (line 234)

---

## üöÄ **HOW TO TEST**

### **STEP 1: Run Diagnosis Workflow (RECOMMENDED FIRST)**

1. Go to: https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/actions
2. Click on "Diagnose VPS Connection" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí "Run workflow" (green button)
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Click on the workflow run to see logs
6. **Expected Result:** Should see successful SSH connection and VPS status

### **STEP 2: Test Emergency Deployment Manually**

1. Go to: https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/actions
2. Click on "Emergency Deploy MT5 Bridge (PowerShell)" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí "Run workflow" (green button)
4. Wait 3-5 minutes
5. Click on the workflow run to see logs
6. **Expected Result:** 
   - ‚úÖ "Service started with PID: XXXX"
   - ‚úÖ "SUCCESS: Service is UP!"
   - ‚úÖ Status Code: 200

### **STEP 3: Wait for Automatic Trigger**

The watchdog will automatically trigger healing when:
- MT5 Bridge fails 3 consecutive health checks (3 minutes)
- Healing cooldown period expires (5 minutes since last attempt)

**Monitor:**
- Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com/services/srv-d3ih7g2dbo4c73fo4330/logs
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/actions

**Expected Sequence:**
1. Watchdog detects failure
2. Triggers GitHub Actions (204 response)
3. PowerShell workflow executes on VPS
4. MT5 Bridge restarts
5. Health check passes
6. Email sent: "Auto-healing SUCCESSFUL"

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

### **In Render Logs:**
```
INFO:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow dispatch successful
INFO:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] ‚úÖ Auto-healing triggered successfully
INFO:alert_service:üìß Email sent successfully to: chavapalmarubin@gmail.com
INFO:alert_service:‚úÖ Recovery notification sent for MT5 Bridge Service
```

### **In GitHub Actions:**
```
‚úÖ Service started with PID: 12345
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Service is UP!
‚úÖ Status Code: 200
‚úÖ Response: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

### **In MT5 Sync Logs:**
```
INFO:mt5_auto_sync_service:‚úÖ MT5 sync completed: 7/7 accounts synced successfully
INFO:mt5_auto_sync_service:üîÑ Background sync completed in 5.2s: 7/7 accounts
```

## üîß **IF DIAGNOSIS FAILS**

### **SSH Connection Issues:**
If the diagnosis workflow shows SSH connection failures:

1. **Verify GitHub Secrets are correct:**
   - Repository: `chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS`
   - Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Check: `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USERNAME`, `VPS_PASSWORD`

2. **Check VPS Firewall:**
   - Ensure port 22 (SSH) is open from GitHub Actions IPs
   - Test manually: `ssh Administrator@217.197.163.11`

3. **Alternative: Use Webhook Approach**
   - If SSH consistently fails, implement webhook-based healing
   - See `FIX #4` in the original guide

### **Service Startup Issues:**
If the service starts but health check fails:

1. **Check VPS logs directly:**
   - RDP into VPS: 217.197.163.11
   - Navigate to: `C:\mt5_bridge_service\logs`
   - Open: `service_emergency.log` and `error_emergency.log`

2. **Common Issues:**
   - Python dependencies missing: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - MetaTrader5 not installed
   - Port 8000 still in use: Use Task Manager to kill process

## üìä **MONITORING CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Render logs show no 422 errors
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows completing successfully
- [ ] MT5 Bridge health endpoint returning 200
- [ ] All 7 accounts syncing (100% success rate)
- [ ] Email alerts received for failures AND recoveries
- [ ] Watchdog consecutive failures reset to 0 after healing

---

## üéì **WHAT TO TELL THE USER**

**The MT5 Auto-Healing system is now ready for testing:**

1. ‚úÖ All code fixes are committed and pushed to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Render has redeployed with latest code
3. ‚úÖ SMTP email alerts are configured and working
4. ‚úÖ Enhanced workflows created for better reliability

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the diagnosis workflow to verify VPS connectivity
2. Manually trigger the emergency deployment to test the workflow
3. Monitor automatic healing when the MT5 Bridge fails naturally

**Timeline:**
- Diagnosis: 2 minutes
- Manual test: 5 minutes  
- Automatic healing: Will trigger within 8 minutes of next MT5 Bridge failure

**The system should now successfully auto-heal the MT5 Bridge when failures are detected!** üöÄ
