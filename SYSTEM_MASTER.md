4.3 Investment Committee Allocation Workflow
**Purpose:** Ensure all MT5 accounts are fully allocated before system changes

**Last Updated:** November 17, 2025  
**Implementation Time:** 7-10 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

**Overview**
The Investment Committee Allocation Workflow ensures NO unassigned MT5 accounts exist and ALL allocations are complete before changes are applied to the system.

**Validation Rules**
Each account MUST have:
•	✅ Manager assigned
•	✅ Fund type assigned
•	✅ Broker assigned
•	✅ Platform assigned

Apply button is disabled until all validations pass.

**Apply Button States**
1. **DISABLED (Gray)** - Validation fails
   - Tooltip shows specific reason
   - Lists unassigned accounts
   - Lists incomplete allocations

2. **ENABLED (Green)** - All validations pass
   - Shows pending changes count
   - Ready to apply

3. **PROCESSING (Spinner)** - Recalculations running
   - Progress indicator visible
   - Cannot cancel during processing

**Triggered Recalculations**
When "Apply Allocations" is clicked, 6 recalculations run:
1. **recalculate_cash_flow()** - Updates investment projections (0.010s)
2. **recalculate_commissions()** - Updates referral & manager fees (0.001s)
3. **update_performance_metrics()** - Updates manager/fund performance (0.001s)
4. **recalculate_pl()** - Recalculates P&L for all entities (0.014s)
5. **update_manager_allocations()** - Updates manager capital totals (0.018s)
6. **update_fund_distributions()** - Updates fund allocation summaries (0.001s)

**Total Execution Time:** ~0.05 seconds

**Database Collections Updated**
•	mt5_accounts - Account status
•	mt5_account_config - VPS sync data
•	investments - Cash flow projections
•	money_managers - Performance metrics
•	fund_allocation_state - Distribution summaries
•	allocation_audit_log - Change history (NEW)
•	allocation_history - Full audit trail (NEW)

**API Endpoints**
Validation:
```
GET /api/admin/investment-committee/validate-allocations
```
Returns: canApply status, unassigned accounts, incomplete accounts

Apply:
```
POST /api/admin/investment-committee/apply-allocations
```
Returns: success status, accounts updated, calculations run

**Error Handling**
•	MongoDB transactions ensure atomic updates
•	Rollback on failure (no partial updates)
•	Clear error messages to admin
•	Complete audit trail maintained

**Security**
•	JWT authentication required
•	Admin-only access
•	All changes logged with timestamp and user

**Performance**
•	Validation check: < 0.1s
•	All recalculations: 0.05s
•	Total apply operation: < 1s

**Audit Trail**
Every allocation change creates entries in:
•	allocation_audit_log - Summary of changes
•	allocation_history - Detailed change log

Includes: timestamp, admin user, accounts affected, changes made

**Testing**
Tested scenarios:
✅ Unassigned accounts block apply
✅ Incomplete allocations block apply
✅ Successful application flow
✅ All recalculations execute
✅ Transaction rollback on error
✅ Audit log creation

9.3.4 Collection: mt5_accounts (Source of Truth)
**Purpose:** Master table for ALL account data - identity, assignments, and real-time metrics

**Schema:**
```javascript
{
  // ===== IDENTITY =====
  account: 885822,                    // MT5/MT4 account number (unique)
  platform: "MT5",                    // Platform type: "MT5" or "MT4"
  broker: "MEXAtlantic",              // Broker name
  server: "MEXAtlantic-Real",         // Server name
  
  // ===== ASSIGNMENTS (Editable in Accounts Management Tab) =====
  fund_type: "CORE",                  // Fund assignment: CORE, BALANCE, SEPARATION, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED
  manager_name: "CP Strategy",        // Manager assignment (links to money_managers)
  status: "active",                   // Account status: "active" or "inactive"
  
  // ===== REAL-TIME DATA (From VPS Bridges) =====
  balance: 20510.43,                  // Account balance (USD)
  equity: 20510.43,                   // Account equity (USD)
  margin: 0,                          // Used margin (USD)
  free_margin: 20510.43,              // Free margin (USD)
  profit: 0,                          // Floating profit/loss (USD)
  
  // ===== POSITIONS & TRADES =====
  open_positions: [],                 // Array of open positions
  open_positions_count: 0,            // Count of open positions
  pending_orders: [],                 // Array of pending orders
  pending_orders_count: 0,            // Count of pending orders
  
  // ===== SYNC METADATA =====
  last_sync_timestamp: ISODate(),     // Last sync from VPS bridge
  data_source: "MT5_BRIDGE",          // Data source identifier
  sync_status: "success",             // Sync status
  sync_error: null                    // Last sync error (if any)
}
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ This collection is the ONLY source for account numbers, balances, and equity
- ✅ fund_type, manager_name, status are editable via Accounts Management tab
- ✅ Real-time data (balance, equity, positions) updated by VPS bridges every 120 seconds
- ❌ NEVER duplicate this data to other collections

9.3.5 Collection: money_managers (Manager Metadata ONLY)
**Purpose:** Store manager-specific metadata (profiles, URLs, fees) - NO account data

**Schema:**
```javascript
{
  // ===== IDENTITY =====
  manager_id: "manager_cp_strategy",  // Unique manager ID
  name: "CP Strategy",                // Manager name (MUST match mt5_accounts.manager_name)
  display_name: "CP Strategy",        // Display name for UI
  
  // ===== METADATA =====
  execution_method: "Copy Trade",     // Execution type: Copy Trade, MAM, HFT Rebate, etc.
  profile_url: "https://...",         // Manager profile URL
  rating_url: "https://...",          // Manager rating URL

```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ Contains ONLY manager metadata (profiles, links, fees)
- ❌ NEVER store account numbers or account lists (assigned_accounts field is FORBIDDEN)
- ❌ NEVER store balances, equity, or any account data
- ✅ Links to mt5_accounts via manager_name field
- ✅ To get manager's accounts: Query mt5_accounts WHERE manager_name = "CP Strategy"

**CRITICAL - What NOT to Store:**
```javascript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - These fields violate SSOT pattern:
{
  "assigned_accounts": [885822, 897590],  // ❌ NO - Query mt5_accounts instead
  "total_balance": 50000,                 // ❌ NO - Calculate from mt5_accounts
  "account_count": 2                      // ❌ NO - Count from mt5_accounts
}
```

9.3.9 How Dashboard Tabs Work

**Accounts Management Tab (Editable)**
- **Data Source:** Direct query of mt5_accounts collection
- **Purpose:** Edit fund_type, manager_name, status assignments
- **API:** GET /api/v2/accounts/all
- **Query:**
```javascript
db.mt5_accounts.find({}, { _id: 0 }).sort({ account: 1 })
```
- **Editable Fields:** fund_type, manager_name, status
- **Effect:** When you edit an account here, ALL other tabs automatically reflect changes

**Fund Portfolio Tab (Derived - Read Only)**
- **Data Source:** mt5_accounts grouped by fund_type
- **Purpose:** Show fund-level aggregations and performance
- **API:** GET /api/v2/derived/fund-portfolio
- **Query:**
```javascript
db.mt5_accounts.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "active" } },
  { $group: { 
      _id: "$fund_type", 
      total_balance: { $sum: "$balance" },
      total_equity: { $sum: "$equity" },
      accounts: { $push: "$$ROOT" }
  }}
])
```

**Money Managers Tab (Derived - Read Only)**
- **Data Source:** mt5_accounts grouped by manager_name + joined with money_managers
- **Purpose:** Show manager-level aggregations with metadata
- **API:** GET /api/v2/derived/money-managers
- **Query:**
```javascript
db.mt5_accounts.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "active" } },
  { $group: { 
      _id: "$manager_name", 
      total_balance: { $sum: "$balance" },
      total_equity: { $sum: "$equity" },
      account_count: { $sum: 1 },
      accounts: { $push: "$$ROOT" }
  }},
  { $lookup: { 
      from: "money_managers", 
      localField: "_id", 
      foreignField: "name", 
      as: "manager_metadata" 
  }}
])
```

**Cash Flow Tab (Derived - Read Only)**
- **Data Source:** All active accounts from mt5_accounts
- **Purpose:** Show cash flow analysis across all accounts
- **API:** GET /api/v2/derived/cash-flow
- **Query:**
```javascript
db.mt5_accounts.find({ status: "active" }, { _id: 0 })
```

**Trading Analytics Tab (Derived - Read Only)**
- **Data Source:** mt5_accounts with positions/history
- **Purpose:** Trading performance analysis
- **API:** GET /api/v2/derived/trading-analytics
- **Query:**
```javascript
db.mt5_accounts.find({ status: "active" }, { _id: 0 })
```

9.3.10 SSOT Benefits
✅ **Data Consistency:** One source of truth means no conflicting data
✅ **No Duplication:** Account data exists in exactly one place
✅ **Auto-Sync:** Edit once in Accounts Management → all tabs update automatically
✅ **Real-time Accuracy:** VPS bridges update one collection → entire system reflects changes
✅ **Simpler Maintenance:** No complex sync logic between collections
✅ **Audit Trail:** All changes tracked in one place

9.3.11 SSOT Critical Rules
❌ **NEVER:**
- Store account numbers in money_managers collection
- Duplicate balance/equity data across collections
- Create separate collections for fund or manager aggregations
- Mix editable and derived data in same collection

✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Query mt5_accounts for ALL account data
- Use aggregation pipelines for grouping/filtering
- Join with money_managers ONLY for metadata
- Validate edits in Accounts Management before applying
- Use transactions when updating account assignments
 
10. FIELD NAMING STANDARDS
10.1 Naming Convention Rules
MongoDB (Database):
•	Use snake_case for ALL field names
•	Examples: account_number, manager_name, created_at
API Responses (Backend → Frontend):
•	Use camelCase for ALL field names
•	Examples: accountNumber, managerName, createdAt
Frontend (React Components):
•	Use camelCase for ALL variable names
•	Examples: accountNumber, managerName, createdAt
10.2 Field Transformation
Backend Responsibility:
The backend MUST transform MongoDB snake_case to API camelCase:
def to_api_format(mongo_doc):
    """Transform MongoDB document to API format"""
    return {
        "accountNumber": mongo_doc["account_number"],
        "managerName": mongo_doc["manager_name"],
        "fundType": mongo_doc["fund_type"],
        "createdAt": mongo_doc["created_at"],
        "updatedAt": mongo_doc["updated_at"]
    }
Use field_registry.py module for all transformations.
10.3 Forbidden Practices
❌ NEVER:
•	Mix snake_case and camelCase in same layer
•	Make up field names not in FIELD_REGISTRY.md
•	Use inconsistent names across collections
•	Hardcode field name strings
✅ ALWAYS:
•	Import from field_registry.py
•	Use defined field mappings
•	Validate field names before use
•	Check FIELD_REGISTRY.md when adding new fields
10.4 Common Field Names
Standard Fields (All Collections):
•	MongoDB: _id, created_at, updated_at
•	API: id, createdAt, updatedAt
Account Fields:
•	MongoDB: account_number, balance, equity, margin
•	API: accountNumber, balance, equity, margin
Manager Fields:
•	MongoDB: manager_name, strategy_name, performance_fee
•	API: managerName, strategyName, performanceFee
Fund Fields:
•	MongoDB: fund_type, interest_rate, payment_frequency
•	API: fundType, interestRate, paymentFrequency

•	Fix Applied: Modified calculate_simulation_projections() to add incubation_months to simulation timeframe
•	Result: 12-month request → 14 months total → 12 interest payments → 30% ROI
•	Verification: ✅ BALANCE fund: 30% ROI | ✅ CORE fund: 18% ROI | ✅ Multi-fund: Correct aggregation
•	Impact: Affects prospects using Investment Simulator - Now matches actual FIDUS investment structure
•	Files Modified: /app/backend/server.py - calculate_simulation_projections()
•	Developer: Emergent | Tested By: Backend Testing Agent | Status: ✅ VERIFIED & DEPLOYED

## **EVEN SIMPLER VERSION:**

If you want it ultra-short:
```
Emergent,

BEFORE ANY WORK, READ THESE TWO DOCUMENTS:

1. https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/blob/main/SYSTEM_MASTER.md
2. https://github.com/chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS/blob/main/.github/EMERGENT_RULES.md

These contain everything about the FIDUS system.

Read them every time before starting work.
Follow the procedures exactly.
Update SYSTEM_MASTER.md after changes.

If the documents conflict with anything else, the documents win.

again and again and again. its tiring to repeat myself to you and to emergent  Please look at all conversations we had 4 managers before And we decided not to use GoldenTrade for this month allocation. And we added two more

1)	 https://ratings.multibankfx.com/widgets/ratings/4119?widgetKey=social_platform_ratings who trades two of our accounts the separation Interest accounts 897591 and 897599. 


2)	the other manager trades our account 897589 which is part of the BALANCE fund allocation and his profile https://ratings.mexatlantic.com/widgets/ratings/5201?widgetKey=social_platform_ratings

3)	accounts 886557 and 891215 are traded by.   https://ratings.multibankfx.com/widgets/ratings/1359?widgetKey=social_platform_ratings which are part of the BALANCE Fund


4)	UNO14 Manager is part also of the BALANCE fund and trades account 886602 as he trades on a MAM and not a COPY his profile is   https://www.fxblue.com/users/gestion_global
          
5)	  CP Strategy trades our CORE fund accounts 897590 and 885822 and his profile is https://ratings.mexatlantic.com/widgets/ratings/3157?widgetKey=social

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE
1. Manager Filtering:
# ✅ CORRECT - Shows 5 active managers
managers = await db.money_managers.find({"status": "active"}).to_list(None)

# ❌ WRONG - Shows all including GoldenTrade
managers = await db.money_managers.find({}).to_list(None)
2. Account Grouping:
# ✅ CORRECT - Groups by fund_type
BALANCE_accounts = [886602, 886557, 891215, 897589]
CORE_accounts = [885822, 897590, 891234]
SEPARATION_accounts = [897591, 897599, 886528, 886066]

# ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded lists
accounts = [886602, 886557, 885822]  # Missing accounts!
3. Field Transformations:
# ✅ CORRECT - Transform at API boundary
@router.get("/api/endpoint")
async def get_data():
    data = await db.collection.find({}).to_list(None)
    return [transform_function(item) for item in data]

# ❌ WRONG - Return raw MongoDB data
@router.get("/api/endpoint")
async def get_data():
    data = await db.collection.find({}).to_list(None)
    return data  # Missing transformation!
4. Investment Linking:
# ✅ CORRECT - Link by client_id (ObjectId)
investment = {
    "client_id": ObjectId("6909e8ebaaf69606babea152"),
    "principal_amount": 100000.00
}

# ❌ WRONG - String ID or wrong field name
investment = {
    "client_id": "client_alejandro",  # Wrong!
    "amount": 100000.00  # Wrong field name!
}
5. Decimal128 Handling:
# ✅ CORRECT - Convert Decimal128 to float
def safe_decimal(value):
    if isinstance(value, Decimal128):
        return float(value.to_decimal())
    return float(value) if value else 0.0

# ❌ WRONG - Return Decimal128 directly
return {"amount": salesperson["total_sales_volume"]}  # Will break JSON!
 
📝 TESTING CHECKLIST
Before claiming ANY fix is complete, verify:
□ Money Managers shows 5 active (not 6, not 3)
□ GoldenTrade is NOT displayed
□ All manager profiles link correctly
□ Cash Flow shows real totals (not $0)
□ Trading Analytics shows positive P&L
□ MT5 Accounts shows all 11 accounts
□ Account allocations sum correctly
□ Salvador shows $118,151.41 total
□ Salvador detail page loads (not 404)
□ No console errors anywhere
□ All fields in camelCase (frontend)
□ All transformations applied
□ No Decimal128 errors

## 14. SECURITY & AUTHENTICATION

### 14.1 Admin User Credentials

**Created:** November 25, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 25, 2025

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Username | admin |
| Password | admin123 |
| Type | admin |
| Email | chavany@me.com |
| Status | active |
| Collection | users |

**Login Endpoint:** `/api/auth/login`

**Authentication Method:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Password stored in `temp_password` field (plaintext as per system design)
- Fallback to "password123" if temp_password doesn't match
- Token expires after configured duration

**Usage:**
```bash
# Login via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123",
    "user_type": "admin"
  }'
```

**Frontend Login:**
1. Navigate to Admin Login page
2. Enter username: `admin`
3. Enter password: `admin123`
4. System returns JWT token for authenticated requests

**Security Notes:**
- Admin account has full access to all dashboard features
- Password should be changed after first login for production use
- JWT tokens must be included in Authorization header for protected endpoints
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
