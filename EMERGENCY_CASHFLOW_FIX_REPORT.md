**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Priority:** 🚨 CRITICAL - Client Demo Emergency  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Cash Flow dashboard displaying **ALL ZEROS** during client demo.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **NO MT5 DATA IN DATABASE** ❌
   - `mt5_deals` collection: 0 documents
   - `mt5_accounts` collection: 0 documents
   - VPS sync had never been run

2. **MISSING INITIAL ALLOCATIONS** ❌
   - All accounts had `initial_allocation = $0.00`
   - All accounts had `status = unknown`
   - Without initial allocations, P&L calculations returned $0.00

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Sync Status
- **VPS Bridge:** Online and accessible
- **Initial Sync:** Completed manually (one-time emergency fix)
- **Ongoing Sync:** VPS sync service should be configured to run automatically
- **Recommended:** Set up automated sync schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes)

### Authentication
- Cash Flow dashboard requires admin authentication
- No test users exist in database currently
- Admin must login to verify dashboard

### Known Limitations
- Some accounts have limited deal history (limit=1000 per account)
- For accounts with 1000+ deals, only recent 1000 were synced
- Consider increasing limit for full historical data
