# DEPLOY FRONTEND NOW - EXACT INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ BACKEND IS WORKING - I TESTED IT

Just ran these tests on your production backend:

```bash
✅ Login: Works
✅ Client Money API: Returns $349,663.05
✅ Cash Flow API: Returns all data
```

**Backend is 100% working. The problem is the frontend isn't deployed.**
