## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Client Dropdown Empty**
- **Cause**: Client not marked as "Ready for Investment"
- **Solution**: Use KYC/AML override process (see Client Management section)

**MT5 Account Already Allocated Error**
- **Cause**: Attempting to reuse MT5 account from another client
- **Solution**: Use different MT5 account numbers for each client

**Allocation Amount Mismatch**
- **Cause**: MT5 account allocations don't sum to investment total
- **Solution**: Verify all allocations add up correctly before submission

**Authentication Issues**  
- **Cause**: JWT token expired or invalid
- **Solution**: Logout and login again with admin credentials

### System Status Checks

**Verify Backend Health:**
- Dashboard should show "Investment Committee [JWT-FIXED]"
- Client count should show "1" (Alejandro only)
- All tabs should be accessible

**Test Investment Creation:**
- Client dropdown should show Alejandro
- All form fields should accept input
- Submission should create investment successfully

### Contact Support
