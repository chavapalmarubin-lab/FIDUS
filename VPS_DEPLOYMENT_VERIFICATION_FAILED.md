# ‚ö†Ô∏è VPS Deployment Verification - NEW Service NOT Running Yet

## Test Results (Just Now)

### ‚ùå New API Service NOT Deployed

**Tested Endpoints (External):**

1. **Root** - `http://217.197.163.11:8000/`
   - ‚úÖ Responding
   - Returns: `{"service":"FIDUS MT5 Bridge Service","version":"1.0.0"}`
   - Note: This is the OLD service response format

2. **Health** - `http://217.197.163.11:8000/api/mt5/bridge/health`
   - ‚ùå Returns: `{"detail":"Not Found"}` (404)
   - Expected: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

3. **Status** - `http://217.197.163.11:8000/api/mt5/status`
   - ‚ùå Returns: `{"detail":"Invalid API key"}`
   - Expected: `{"status":"online",...}` (no auth required)

4. **Account Info** - `http://217.197.163.11:8000/api/mt5/account/886602/info`
   - ‚ùå Returns: `{"detail":"Not Found"}` (404)
   - Expected: `{"account_id":886602,...}`

**Backend Logs:**
```
ERROR:mt5_auto_sync_service:‚ùå Bridge HTTP error 404: {"detail":"Not Found"}
ERROR:mt5_auto_sync_service:‚ùå All MT5 fetch attempts failed
CRITICAL:mt5_auto_sync_service:üö® ALERT: MT5 sync success rate low: 0.0%
```

## üîç Diagnosis

**The OLD service is still running on VPS, NOT the new FastAPI service.**

**Evidence:**
- Root endpoint shows old version
- All new endpoints return 404
- Same 404 errors as before
- 0/7 accounts syncing (same as before)

---

## ‚úÖ What WAS Done

1. ‚úÖ New FastAPI service created (`mt5_bridge_api_service.py`)
2. ‚úÖ All 7 endpoints implemented
3. ‚úÖ Backend proxy routes created and loaded
4. ‚úÖ Code merged to main branch
5. ‚úÖ Documentation created

---

## ‚ùå What WASN'T Done

**The new service file has NOT been deployed to the VPS yet.**

The file `mt5_bridge_api_service.py` needs to be:
1. Copied to VPS: `C:\mt5_bridge_service\`
2. Old service stopped
3. New service started

---

## üöÄ Required Actions

### **To Deploy the New Service:**

**Option 1: Git Push (if you have access)**
```bash
git push origin main
# GitHub Actions will auto-deploy
```

**Option 2: Manual Copy to VPS**
```powershell
# On VPS via RDP (217.197.163.11:42014)
cd C:\mt5_bridge_service

# Stop old service
Get-Process python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Copy new file (from workspace or GitHub)
# mt5_bridge_api_service.py ‚Üí C:\mt5_bridge_service\

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start NEW service
python mt5_bridge_api_service.py
```

**Option 3: Emergent Deploys**
Send Emergent the deployment instructions with RDP credentials.

---

## üìä Expected Results After Deployment

Once new service is deployed:

```bash
# Health endpoint
$ curl http://217.197.163.11:8000/api/mt5/bridge/health
{"status":"healthy","mt5":{"available":true},...}  ‚úÖ

# Status endpoint
$ curl http://217.197.163.11:8000/api/mt5/status
{"status":"online","accounts":{"total":7,...}}  ‚úÖ

# Account info
$ curl http://217.197.163.11:8000/api/mt5/account/886602/info
{"account_id":886602,"name":"FIDUS A",...}  ‚úÖ
```

**Backend logs should show:**
```
‚úÖ MT5 sync completed: 7/7 accounts synced successfully
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If you said "all set" but tests show old service:**

1. **Check if new file exists on VPS**
   ```powershell
   Test-Path C:\mt5_bridge_service\mt5_bridge_api_service.py
   ```

2. **Check which Python file is running**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process python | Select-Object Id,CommandLine
   ```

3. **Check service logs**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\mt5_bridge_service\logs\api_service.log -Tail 50
   ```

4. **Verify port 8000 process**
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :8000
   ```

## üìù Summary

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment NOT Complete
- Code: ‚úÖ Ready in workspace
- VPS: ‚ùå Old service still running
- Endpoints: ‚ùå Still returning 404
- MT5 Sync: ‚ùå Still 0/7 (0%)

**Next Step**: Deploy new service file to VPS and restart

**Did you:**
- [ ] Push to GitHub?
- [ ] Copy files to VPS manually?
- [ ] Ask Emergent to deploy?
- [ ] Something else?

Please confirm what deployment action was taken, so I can help troubleshoot if needed.
