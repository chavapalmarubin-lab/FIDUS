The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a challenging, iterative process to implement Google OAuth and API integrations. Initially, it focused on resolving a persistent sign-in loop caused by  syntax errors in the backend and  issues, transitioning from direct Google OAuth to Emergent OAuth and back again. Key decisions included fixing MongoDB  calls, bypassing JWT for the session creation endpoint, and continually adapting to user feedback. Later, the work shifted to implementing real Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet APIs, including document signing. Frustration from the user led to multiple refactors and suggestions to contact support. The final phase involved integrating Google Social Login with preserved FIDUS branding and debugging recurring authentication issues, such as an admin login routing error and the crucial JWT token not being stored in  after login. The engineer repeatedly confirmed fixes through testing, only to discover new underlying problems reported by the user.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform for clients and admins, featuring AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation, automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring.

**User's Explicit Requests & Intents:**
1.  **Google OAuth Integration (Primary Priority):** Enable admin users to authenticate with Google for emails, meetings, and documents using a personal Gmail account. This needs to provide consolidated access to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Sheets.
2.  **Gmail Integration:** Allow scheduling calendar meetings and sending/receiving Drive-signed documents to clients.
3.  **Real Google API Integration:** The system must fetch *real* Gmail, Calendar, and Drive data, not mock data.
4.  **Document Signing Functionality:** Implement document upload, PDF viewing, electronic signature capture, and email notifications.
5.  **Google Social Login/Signup:** Integrate Google login/signup functionality for users, preserving existing FIDUS branding (logos, colors, animations).
6.  **Admin Login Routing:** Ensure admin users are correctly redirected to the admin portal after login, not the client portal.
7.  **Robust Authentication:** Fix persistent login loops,  errors, and JWT token handling.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Core API routing. Heavily modified for Google OAuth, Emergent OAuth, real Google API integrations, and social login. Fixes for  MongoDB calls, JWT middleware bypass, and endpoint additions for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and document signing.
-   ****: Stores backend environment variables. Updated with  and later , , and  for real Google API integration.
-   ** (NEW)**: Intended for personal Gmail API calls, but its logic was largely integrated into  and later superseded by a broader .
-   ** (NEW)**: Created to encapsulate actual Google API calls using  and Google SDKs. Used for Gmail messages, sending emails, calendar events, and Drive files.
-   ** (NEW)**: Manages Emergent Google Social Login backend logic, handling user authentication and token issuance.
-   ** (NEW)**: Centralizes real Google API interactions for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc., using credentials.
-   ** (NEW)**: Handles logic for document uploads, PDF viewing, signature capture, and generating signed documents.
-   ****: Main application component. Modified to handle Google OAuth redirects, manage global authentication state, and initially converted to React Router then reverted to a view-based system. Most recently, fixed to correctly store the JWT token from backend login.
-   ****: Initial login page. Modified to integrate Google Social Login while preserving original FIDUS branding and design, including the logo and animations.
-   ** (NEW)**: Frontend component for Google social login button and associated UI. Styled to match FIDUS theme.
-   ** (NEW)**: Separate page for login functionality.
-   ** (NEW)**: Separate page for signup functionality.
-   ****: Handles redirects from Google OAuth. Updated multiple times to process authorization codes/session IDs and store tokens. Modified to use the new  endpoint and handle the  response format.
-   ****: Admin UI for Google Workspace features. Modified to fix tab styling (white-on-white text) and integrate real Gmail/Calendar/Drive functionality. Added a Compose Email modal.
-   ** (NEW)**: Frontend component to display real Gmail, Calendar, and Drive data.
-   ** (NEW)**: Frontend component for document signing workflow.
-   ****: Custom hook for Google admin authentication. Updated to initiate new real Google APIs OAuth flow (), manage session checks, and remove reliance on  for authentication.
-   ****: Authentication utility.
-   ****: Updated with custom CSS for Google Social Login button styling.
-   ****: Downloaded and saved to the public folder.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical authentication issue reported by the user: the Connect Google Workspace button was not initiating the OAuth flow, and the user suspected something was unclickable. Initial investigation revealed the button was clickable, but the subsequent API call to generate the OAuth URL was failing due to an Admin authentication required error.

The root cause identified was that the backend-issued JWT token, which is essential for authenticated API calls, was **not being stored in  as ** during the traditional admin login process in . While  correctly passed  to , the  function itself only set the user data to state () but failed to persist the JWT  (from ) into . This meant subsequent calls requiring authentication, like initiating Google OAuth, lacked the necessary  in their headers, causing them to be rejected.

The AI engineer has successfully edited  to explicitly store  into  within the  function, resolving this critical JWT token storage oversight.
