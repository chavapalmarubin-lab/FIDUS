## Known Limitations

### 1. Client Onboarding Workarounds

**Current Implementation:**
- Client readiness uses admin override system
- KYC/AML compliance bypassed for testing

**Limitation Details:**
```
✅ Override system works correctly
❌ Document upload interface not implemented
❌ Google Drive integration not connected
❌ Automated compliance workflow missing
```

**Workaround:**
Use admin override in KYC/AML tab:
1. Check "Override readiness requirements"
2. Enter reason: "Manual verification completed offline"  
3. Client becomes ready for investment

**Production Impact:** 
Admin must manually verify compliance before applying override.

### 2. Legacy Investment Modal

**Current Implementation:**
- Enhanced MT5 investment creation component built (`InvestmentCreationWithMT5.js`)
- Legacy modal still displays in some workflows

**Limitation Details:**
```
✅ Enhanced component has all new features  
✅ Backend endpoints support enhanced functionality
❌ Legacy modal shows "0 ready clients" due to authentication timing
❌ Not all UI paths use enhanced component
```

**Workaround:**
Access investment creation through main "Create Investment" button. System functionality works correctly despite dropdown display issue.

**Production Impact:** 
Core functionality unaffected. Investment creation works properly.

### 3. Investment Dashboard Integration

**Current Implementation:**
- `InvestmentDetailView.js` component created with full functionality
- Shows investment summary, timeline, MT5 accounts, financial tracking

**Limitation Details:**
```
✅ Component built and functional
❌ Not integrated into main application navigation
❌ Requires manual integration to view created investments
```

**Workaround:**
Investment data can be viewed via:
- Database queries
- API endpoint calls  
- Backend testing tools confirm all data is properly stored

**Production Impact:**
Investment creation and data storage work correctly. Dashboard access requires navigation integration.

### 4. MT5 Bridge Service Dependencies

**Current Implementation:**
- MT5 integration endpoints operational
- Windows VPS bridge service configured

**Limitation Details:**
```
✅ API endpoints respond correctly
✅ Account allocation and validation working
❌ Live MT5 trading platform connection may require additional setup
❌ Real-time balance updates not implemented
```

**Workaround:**
System tracks MT5 accounts and allocations correctly. Live trading data can be added when MT5 bridge is fully connected.

**Production Impact:**
Investment and account management fully functional. Live trading data requires MT5 bridge completion.

## Workarounds for Production Use

### 1. Client Onboarding Process

**Current Workflow:**
1. Collect client documents offline (email, physical delivery)
2. Verify compliance manually
3. Use admin override to mark client ready
4. Document verification in override notes field

**Required Documentation:**
```
Override Reason Examples:
"Manual KYC/AML verification completed. Documents reviewed: Passport, Government ID, Proof of Residence, AML report generated, Investment Agreement signed. All compliance requirements satisfied."
```

### 2. Investment Creation Process

**Current Workflow:**
1. Login as admin (admin/password123)
2. Navigate to Investments tab
3. Click "Create Investment" button  
4. Select ready client (Alejandro or others after override)
5. Configure investment with MT5 accounts
6. System handles all automation (dates, validation, storage)

**Validation Steps:**
- Verify MT5 account numbers are unique per client
- Confirm allocations sum to investment total
- Ensure investor passwords (not trading passwords)
- Complete allocation notes for compliance

### 3. Investment Monitoring

**Current Workflow:**
1. Use backend API to query investment data
2. Access MongoDB directly for detailed records
3. Use MT5 Management tab to view account allocations
4. Reference investment ID for tracking: `inv_cd955aac85f94e29`

**Data Verification:**
```bash
# Check investment via API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/investments/inv_cd955aac85f94e29

# View MT5 allocations  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/mt5/pool/statistics
```
