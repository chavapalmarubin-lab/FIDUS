## 📊 Live Monitoring Evidence

**From Backend Logs:**

```
INFO:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] 🚀 Starting MT5 Watchdog monitoring loop
INFO:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] Check interval: 60s
INFO:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] Data freshness threshold: 15 minutes
INFO:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] Failure threshold for auto-healing: 3 failures

INFO:root:✅ MT5 Watchdog initialized successfully
INFO:root:   Monitoring interval: 60 seconds
INFO:root:   Auto-healing threshold: 3 consecutive failures
INFO:root:   GitHub token configured: True

WARNING:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] ⚠️ MT5 Bridge unhealthy - Consecutive failures: 1/3
WARNING:mt5_watchdog:[MT5 WATCHDOG] ⚠️ MT5 Bridge unhealthy - Consecutive failures: 2/3
```

**Status:** Watchdog is detecting the MT5 Bridge issue (404 on health endpoint) and counting failures. On the next check (in ~60 seconds), it will reach 3/3 and trigger auto-healing!

---

## 🔧 What Happens Next (Automatic)

**In the next 1-2 minutes:**

1. ⏳ **Watchdog performs 3rd health check**
2. ⚠️ **Detects 3rd consecutive failure**
3. 🔧 **Triggers auto-healing:**
   - Sends request to GitHub Actions API
   - Workflow: `deploy-mt5-bridge-emergency.yml`
   - Action: Restart MT5 Bridge service on VPS
4. ⏱️ **Waits 30 seconds for service restart**
5. ✅ **Verifies health again**
6. 📧 **Sends notification:**
   - If successful: INFO recovery email
   - If failed: CRITICAL alert email

---

## 🧪 Auto-Healing Will Attempt

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- Repository: `chavapalmarubin-lab/FIDUS`
- Workflow: `deploy-mt5-bridge-emergency.yml`
- Action:
  1. SSH to VPS (217.197.163.11)
  2. Kill all Python processes
  3. Free port 8000 (3 aggressive attempts)
  4. Pull latest code from GitHub
  5. Start `mt5_bridge_api_service.py`
  6. Verify service health

**Expected Result:**
- MT5 Bridge restarts successfully
- Health check returns 200 OK
- Watchdog sends INFO recovery email
- Failure counter resets to 0

## 📋 Production Deployment Steps

### For User (Chava):

**Step 1: Deploy Code to GitHub**
```
Click "Save to GitHub" button in Emergent interface
This will push all code changes to GitHub repository
```

**Step 2: Add GitHub Token to Render**
```
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/fidus-api
2. Navigate to: Environment
3. Add variable:
   Key: GITHUB_TOKEN
   Value: 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
4. Click: "Save Changes"
5. Render will automatically restart backend
```

**Step 3: Verify Production Deployment**
```
After Render restarts (2-3 minutes):

1. Check logs:
   - Render Dashboard → fidus-api → Logs
   - Look for: "MT5 Watchdog initialized successfully"
   - Look for: "Starting MT5 Watchdog monitoring loop"

2. Test API endpoint:
   curl https://fidus-api.onrender.com/api/system/mt5-watchdog/status

3. Monitor for auto-healing:
   - Watch logs for failure tracking
   - Wait for auto-healing trigger
   - Check email for notification
```

**Step 4: Verify Frontend Deployment**
```
1. Visit: https://fidus-investment-platform.onrender.com
2. Navigate to: Admin Dashboard
3. Check: System Health section
4. Verify: MT5 Watchdog widget (if added to frontend)
```
