The AI engineer's work began with a persistent frontend issue: a Create Client Investment legacy modal appearing instead of the intended . Initial attempts involved extensive debugging, searching for the modal's source, and addressing authentication token mismatches and endpoint corrections. This led to the discovery of a deployment/caching issue where the production environment wasn't serving the latest frontend build, leading to a temporary handoff for infrastructure intervention.

Subsequently, the AI shifted focus to pending tasks, successfully implementing a KYC/AML document upload interface and integrating an Investment Detail View, although these also required debugging due to initial deployment and API endpoint mismatches. A critical Google OAuth persistence problem for  was then tackled, leading to a new  module and frontend updates. This again highlighted an external nginx routing issue, which the AI worked around by leveraging existing, working Google OAuth endpoints.

The most recent and critical task involved resolving MT5 integration errors on Render, specifically Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running errors and file permission issues. The AI diagnosed these as nested  loop conflicts and hardcoded paths. Comprehensive fixes were implemented, involving  background tasks, delayed service instantiation, and environment-aware path management using a new . The AI confirmed these fixes locally, but faced a GitHub authentication issue for pushing the changes. The current trajectory concludes with the user requesting the complete modified file contents for manual GitHub upload.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for internal admin users, requiring secure JWT/Google OAuth authentication, MongoDB Atlas, and real-time MetaTrader5 (MT5) financial data. Core features include unlimited MT5 account mapping per investment, investor password-only acceptance, admin-approved MT5 account deallocation with audit trails, and Google Workspace integration (Gmail, Calendar, Drive). Recent developments focused on:
1.  **Just-in-Time MT5 Allocation**: Backend refactored, frontend UI for multiple accounts and date calculations.
2.  **Client Readiness System**: Implemented with an override mechanism (KYC/AML process).
3.  **Investment Detail View**: Basic component created for displaying investment specifics.
4.  **Google OAuth Persistence**: User-specific (chavapalmarubin@gmail.com) authentication to persist across sessions, leveraging existing Google services.
5.  **Render Deployment Compatibility**: Adapting file paths for production environments (e.g., /tmp for writable files) to resolve .
6.  **MT5 Event Loop Fixes**: Resolving  conflicts and initialization issues for MT5 services on Render.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and locally verified critical fixes for MT5 integration errors on the Render production environment. The primary issues addressed were  event loop conflicts (e.g., Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running) and file permission errors due to hardcoded paths. The engineer refactored  initialization, , and introduced a delayed service instantiation pattern with a  getter. A new  file was created to manage environment-aware file paths, ensuring writable files go to  on Render and read-only files correctly reference the source repository. This involved modifications to  and , among other files.

The AI confirmed these changes locally, with logs showing successful background task scheduling and no event loop errors. However, the AI encountered a GitHub authentication issue, preventing it from pushing the changes. The user has since requested the complete contents of the modified files (, , ) to manually upload them to GitHub.
