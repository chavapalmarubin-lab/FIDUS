The AI engineer's work initially focused on stabilizing the Google Workspace OAuth integration for the FIDUS platform, resolving   by adding  keywords in , , and . This was followed by fixing frontend routing issues (black page) by adjusting backend redirects and introducing React Router routes in . A database diagnostic phase revealed expired Google OAuth tokens for , leading to the creation and refinement of backend endpoints (, ) to properly fetch and refresh tokens and return statuses matching frontend expectations (string-based ). The UI finally showed connected. However, new critical bugs were immediately identified from logs: a  in , duplicate  prefixes causing 404s for Calendar/Drive endpoints, and a failing disconnect function. The current task is to fix these three newly reported bugs.

The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system providing real-time account data. Key requirements include:
*   **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Monitors MT5 Bridge API (60-second intervals), triggers auto-healing via GitHub Actions after three consecutive failures, and sends email alerts.
*   **Infrastructure Migration**: All references to the old VPS infrastructure must be removed.
*   **Prospects Portal**: Development of a  section for lead capture, including an investment simulator () with a dark, professional theme.
*   **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: A complete rebuild enabling admin users (specifically ) to connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive for email, meeting scheduling, event management, and file operations. This requires explicit account selection (),  pre-selection, consistent callback URIs, centralized credential management, and robust OAuth state handling. So far, the core OAuth flow for token acquisition and storage is functional, and the frontend now correctly displays the Google Workspace connection status. However, deeper issues with individual API calls (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) and the disconnect functionality have emerged, alongside URL routing errors.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, PyMongo, APScheduler, httpx, requests, logging), MongoDB.
-   **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM.
-   **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Supervisor, Render.com.
-   **Architectural Patterns**: Auto-healing, Health Monitoring, Google OAuth 2.0, Service-Oriented Architecture, Asynchronous Programming.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Main FastAPI application handling API routes and background tasks.
    -   **Importance**: Central routing and logic for Google OAuth.
    -   **Changes**:  fixes were applied to  calls. Backend redirects after Google OAuth were simplified to . A new GET endpoint  was added to check and refresh Google OAuth tokens. The  endpoint was modified to return string-based  (e.g., ) to match frontend expectations.
-   ****: Manages Google OAuth 2.0 flow.
    -   **Importance**: Generates authorization URLs and handles callbacks.
    -   **Changes**: Methods like  were made , and calls within  were updated to .  was updated to await  and .
-   ****: Manages secure storage and refreshing of Google OAuth tokens in MongoDB.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for token persistence and automatic refreshing.
    -   **Changes**: All PyMongo operations were updated with  to resolve  objects. The  method is designed to automatically refresh expired tokens using the .
-   ****: Main React application file.
    -   **Importance**: Defines UI structure and routing.
    -   **Changes**: React Router routes were explicitly added or modified to handle  paths to address no routes matched errors.
-   ****: React component responsible for Google Workspace integration logic.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates API calls to the backend to verify connection status.
    -   **Changes**: Contains logic to call  and expects individual API connection statuses.
-   ****: React component displaying the detailed Google Workspace connection status.
    -   **Importance**: Renders the connection status and individual service details.
    -   **Changes**: Was found to be expecting string values (, etc.) for  from the backend endpoint , which prompted a backend change to match this format.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full end-to-end testing and verification of Gmail/Calendar/Drive functionalities beyond connection status.
-   Deployment and final verification of the Google Workspace integration in the production environment.
-   Implement Phase 2 and 3 of the Prospects Portal.
-   Complete comprehensive system audit and verification of all data flows.
-   **Fix  in  (Gmail API Call).**
-   **Fix frontend API URLs with double  prefix for Calendar and Drive endpoints.**
-   **Fix the Google account disconnect functionality.**

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully addressed the display of Google Workspace connection status on the frontend. After diagnosing that MongoDB contained an expired Google OAuth token and that the frontend components were expecting specific string-based statuses, the AI:
1.  Created the  endpoint in  to allow the frontend to check and refresh Google OAuth tokens.
2.  Modified the  endpoint in  to return a  as a descriptive string (e.g., ) instead of a boolean, matching the  component's expectations.
This led to the frontend () correctly displaying All Google services connected (though with a 0% success rate anomaly, later confirmed to be 75% internally) and individual services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) as connected, with the Gmail inbox content loading.

However, the user, upon reviewing logs, immediately identified three critical, lingering issues despite the UI showing 'connected':
1.  A  occurring when  is called with redundant  arguments in .
2.   errors for  and  due to a duplicate  prefix in frontend API calls (resulting in ).
3.  The disconnect function for Google accounts is failing, indicating No Google connection found to disconnect, suggesting an issue with token identification or deletion.
The AI is currently working on fixing these three identified bugs, starting with the  in the Gmail API call.
