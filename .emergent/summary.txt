The AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive FIDUS financial portal, evolving it from a foundational MVP to a feature-rich application. The work began with implementing an animated logo and a dual-dashboard system for clients and administrators. Key features such as user registration, Excel-based client management, and a secure password reset process were added incrementally. A significant pivot involved replacing mock OCR and AML/KYC processes with real integrations using Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision, and ComplyAdvantage. This iterative development included promptly addressing bugs, like the initial logo animation issue. The project concluded its last major feature implementation with a robust password reset system. Currently, a document portal with DocuSign integration was initiated but paused, as the user introduced a new, extensive request for a complete CRM system, which is now the primary focus.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack financial website with an animated FIDUS logo, dual login (Client/Admin), and respective dashboards. The Client Dashboard needed balance/transaction history, client profile, and search functionalities. The Admin Dashboard was to include AUM, allocation, performance charts, data simulation, and import/export capabilities.
Subsequent features included:
1.  **First-Time User Registration**: A multi-step process with ID upload, real AML/KYC verification, and email-based credential delivery.
2.  **Excel Client Management**: Admin portal functionality for uploading and downloading a client database via Excel/CSV.
3.  **Password Reset**: A comprehensive system for both client and admin logins, including email verification.
4.  **Document Portal**: An archive for signed documents and integration with DocuSign for sending agreements.
The latest and most extensive request is for a comprehensive **CRM system** for a hedge fund platform (FIDUS Solutions LLC), encompassing client onboarding, investor allocation across four funds (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV dashboards, role-based investor/manager portals, secure document storage, compliance reminders (FATCA, CRS, FSRC), banking/broker API integration, multi-currency support, communication tools, exportable reports (PDF/Excel), robust encryption, audit trails, regulatory compliance, and integrations with accounting, n8n, and e-signature tools.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in developing the Document Portal with DocuSign integration, a feature requested by the user to enable document archiving and e-signature capabilities for both clients and administrators. As part of this, the frontend component  was successfully created (Chat Message 244), and the integration agent () was consulted for DocuSign integration guidance (Chat Message 242).

However, this task was interrupted by a new, significantly larger request from the user for a comprehensive CRM system for FIDUS Solutions LLC (Chat Message 245). This CRM is an extensive project encompassing fund management, regulatory compliance, multi-currency operations, and numerous integrations. The AI engineer's most recent action was to acknowledge this new CRM request (Chat Message 246), indicating a shift in immediate focus. Therefore, the current work has pivoted to the initial planning and architectural conceptualization of this complex CRM system, with the Document Portal development now considered a pending task.
