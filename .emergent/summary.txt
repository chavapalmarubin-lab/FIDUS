The AI engineer's work focused on preparing the FIDUS application for its first production client, Alejandro Mariscal. Key challenges included resolving Render deployment issues (MongoDB authentication, file system permissions, frontend build complexities like path aliases and circular imports). Extensive debugging led to successful frontend deployment and initial client data setup. A major pivot occurred due to MT5's single-session limitation, leading to the development of a multi-account sequential login and data collection solution for MT5. While live MT5 data is now flowing into MongoDB, a critical client ID mapping issue persists, preventing the frontend dashboard from displaying Alejandro's investment and MT5 data correctly. Backend API endpoints now return accurate data, but the frontend remains disconnected, showing zero values.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system integrating MongoDB Atlas and MetaTrader5 (MT5) with JWT/Google OAuth. Core functionalities include Just-in-Time MT5 allocation, a Client Readiness System, and Investment Detail View. Compatibility for Render deployment and MT5 event loop fixes were crucial. The primary goal was to onboard Alejandro Mariscal with:
- Client record creation (alexmar7609@gmail.com, ).
- Two investments: BALANCE (00,000) and CORE (8,151.41).
- Four MT5 accounts with real credentials (MEXAtlantic broker, FIDUS13@ password).
- Frontend deployment to Render and verification of Alejandroâ€™s data.
Implementation involved refactoring and adding specific scripts/components for Alejandro's data and ensuring live MT5 data integration, overcoming MT5's single-session constraint with a sequential login solution.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully established the MT5 multi-account data collection using a sequential login pattern, addressing MT5's single-session limitation. Live MT5 data (balance, equity, profit/loss) is now flowing from the MT5 Bridge Service into MongoDB every 15 minutes. Backend API endpoints (, ) and a new frontend  component were implemented and integrated into the . However, the frontend  still displays /bin/bash Total AUM, 0 Total Clients, /bin/bash for both CORE and BALANCE funds despite backend APIs returning correct aggregated data for Alejandro and his MT5 accounts. The root cause has been identified as a **client mapping problem** for the live MT5 data in MongoDB, where MT5 accounts exist but are not correctly linked to .
