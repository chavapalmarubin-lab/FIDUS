The AI engineer's trajectory describes a multi-phase development and bug-fixing process for the FIDUS investment management platform. Initially, the focus was on establishing a Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System for the admin portal. This involved creating backend logic in , new API endpoints in , and a frontend dashboard component .

Significant effort was dedicated to debugging and refining the fund performance calculations. Key issues addressed included correctly integrating the  into the , resolving database connection inconsistencies (moving from  to ), and rectifying calculation logic. Critical corrections were made to: 1) use the actual MT5 deposit amount and date as the source of truth, 2) switch from compound to simple interest, and 3) redefine the MT5 actual return calculation to include withdrawals and current equity.

Concurrently, frontend UX improvements were made: removing a redundant Investments tab from the client dashboard, enhancing the  for better visual data, and a multi-turn logo replacement/resizing task to ensure the FIDUS logo was correctly and visibly displayed across all application headers and pages. The final stage involves preparing for a comprehensive stress test.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform supporting client/admin roles, AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring. Recent enhancements focused on a Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System.

Specific requirements and implementations include:
1.  **Robust Authentication**: JWT-based system implemented across backend and frontend.
2.  **UX Consistency**: Resolved missing CSS import and improved calendar view.
3.  **Database Stability**: Fixed Cash Flow database errors and resolved database connection inconsistencies for fund performance module.
4.  **Multi-Broker MT5 Integration**: Expanded MT5 support to DooTechnology alongside Multibank.
5.  **Real-Time MT5 Data**: System for collecting and displaying real-time MT5 trading data.
6.  **Fund Performance Management**: An internal system and admin dashboard to compare FIDUS client fund commitments against real-time MT5 returns. This system requires:
    *   MT5 data as the primary source for investment amounts, start dates, and actual returns (Profit + Withdrawal + Current Balance).
    *   Simple interest calculations for FIDUS fund commitments.
    *   Displaying only funds with actual client investments in the admin's Client Investment Deliverables tab.
    *   Ensuring no FIDUS funds are marked as Guaranteed.
    *   Separate client-side view (showing FIDUS promises) from admin-side view (showing MT5 reality vs. commitment).
7.  **Client Dashboard**: Display correct client investment balance, reflecting actual fund investments (e.g., BALANCE fund) instead of hardcoded generic balances. Remove redundant tabs.
8.  **Branding**: Update application-wide logo with new FIDUS logo, ensuring proper sizing and visibility in all key areas (login, dashboards, loading screen).

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the integration of the  component with real data and visualizations (from initial pending tasks, not touched in this trajectory).
-   The  module was created but its actual implementation for connecting to MetaTrader5 and retrieving historical data is pending due to package installation issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had successfully addressed all identified bugs and feature requests related to the Fund Performance Management System, client dashboard display, and application-wide logo integration.

The system now correctly:
1.  Calculates fund performance using **real MT5 data** (deposit amount, profit, withdrawal, current balance).
2.  Applies **simple interest** for FIDUS expected returns.
3.  Derives the investment **start date from MT5 data** (April 2020, then changed to April 2025 for testing).
4.  Displays only the **BALANCE fund** in the admin Client Investment Deliverables tab, as it's the only one with active client data.
5.  Shows the **correct FIDUS logo** with appropriate sizing across all application pages (login, dashboards, loading screen).

The last interaction (Chat Message 707) was the user requesting a comprehensive stress test of the application before going to production on Monday. The AI engineer acknowledged this request (Chat Message 708) and started to read  to prepare for updating the test plan for the stress test (Chat Message 709-712). The state is poised for defining and executing this final pre-production testing.
