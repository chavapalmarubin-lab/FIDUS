The AI engineer's trajectory involved a comprehensive effort to build and refine the FIDUS investment platform, primarily focusing on robust Google Workspace integration and a state-of-the-art CRM. The work began with a complete overhaul of Google OAuth after initial issues, transitioning to a REAL Google OAuth flow. Subsequent development included implementing a Google-style connection monitor, comprehensive Google API integrations for Gmail, Calendar, and Drive, both for admin and client dashboards. A significant portion of the work addressed user-reported bugs, including data loading inconsistencies, UI/UX flaws (e.g., white-on-white text), and critical privacy issues related to Google Drive document segregation. Towards the end, the focus shifted to refining the CRM pipeline, automating Google Drive folder creation for leads/clients, and resolving persistent backend issues like MongoDB schema validation errors, datetime timezone errors, and Google API authentication failures. The engineer systematically debugged and implemented features, often iterating based on user feedback and screenshots.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal aims to be a comprehensive investment management platform for clients and admins, integrating robust Google Workspace functionality and advanced document handling. Key requirements include:
1.  **Google OAuth Integration**: Admin users authenticate with personal Gmail accounts for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet access.
2.  **Real Google API Integration**: Fetches and displays real Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet data for both admin and client portals.
3.  **Gmail Integration**: Supports sending/receiving FIDUS-to-client emails for clients; full Gmail access for admins.
4.  **Calendar Integration**: Enables creation and management of events, including Google Meet links. Client meeting requests should go to the admin portal.
5.  **Drive Integration**: Manages documents with a segregated Google Drive folder per lead/client. Clients can upload documents to their pre-created FIDUS folder.
6.  **Document Signing Functionality**: Document upload, PDF viewing, electronic signature capture, and email notifications (Salvador Palma default signee).
7.  **Google Social Login/Signup**: Initially implemented, then disabled.
8.  **Admin Login Routing**: Admins redirect correctly post-login, with Google-style connection monitor.
9.  **CRM Integration**: Google functionalities (email, meetings, document requests) integrated within CRM prospect/client details.
10. **Robust Authentication**: Addressed login loops, , JWT token handling, and frontend authentication state persistence.
11. **CRM Pipeline**: Stages (Lead to Negotiation to Won/Lost) with ability to move leads, a convert to client button, and required AML/KYC for clients.
12. **User Admin Functions**: Standard user administration for managing users.
13. **Google Connection Certification**: Procedure to certify Google API connection status (Gmail, Calendar, Drive).
14. **Full Google Workspace Experience**: Comprehensive, Google-like integration within the application's UI, tailored for admin and client roles.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical bugs in the admin portal and CRM system, specifically after a comprehensive test revealed mixed results. The user reported an error when creating a client. The AI identified that the primary issues are:
1.  **MongoDB schema validation errors** that prevent new prospects/clients from being created or updated in the database.
2.  **Google Drive folder data not persisting** in prospect responses, implying that even if folders are created, their IDs or associated data are not correctly stored or retrieved.
3.  **Calendar API authentication failures**, causing server errors and preventing calendar events from loading despite the connection monitor showing as connected.

The AI engineer has acknowledged the user's report of an error when creating a client and is now focused on fixing the MongoDB schema validation issue.
