The trajectory chronicles a highly iterative and often frustrating development process. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical login and dashboard display issues stemming from a stale frontend environment variable and a misconfigured JWT token secret. Repeated attempts to fix the JWT authentication proved challenging, with the middleware logic often overriding temporary unprotection efforts. A significant issue was the repeated confusion and data inconsistency regarding Alejandro's client status and investment totals, leading to user frustration. The MongoDB Atlas connection was severely misconfigured, starting with a local host, then an incorrect password, and finally persistent local fallbacks and a hardcoded database name, all causing production stability problems. Despite multiple attempts to create Alejandro's investments, the process was fraught with errors, leading to the accidental creation of 10 investments instead of the requested 4, and significant data corruption. The MT5 API connectivity was also found to be non-functional initially. The trajectory concludes with the user expressing extreme dissatisfaction and providing a new, comprehensive 10-phase implementation guide for MongoDB Atlas integration, effectively resetting the current work focus.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform aims to be a robust investment management system for admin users, requiring individual Google Workspace integration via OAuth 2.0. This includes secure token storage for seamless access to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Sheets, supporting CRM functions like emailing and scheduling. All user, client, and investment data must reside in a production-grade MongoDB Atlas database, replacing mock data. The admin dashboard needs to display accurate, real-time financial data, like AUM and cash flow, with Excel export functionality. A key requirement is the accurate creation and management of client investments, which involves MT5 API integration for real-time trading account data. The system must maintain data consistency and provide a reliable, production-ready environment.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a React frontend and a Python FastAPI backend, backed by MongoDB.



- ****
  - **Importance:** Central backend, hosts API endpoints, business logic, authentication, and database interactions.
  - **Changes:** Extensive modifications to JWT token creation/verification logic, middleware for authentication bypass attempts, adding investment creation and deletion endpoints, and initial waiver logic for fund minimums. Crucially, the hardcoded  fallback was removed.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Stores environment variables like  and .
  - **Changes:** Updated  multiple times, first from  to an incorrect MongoDB Atlas string, then to the correct one with the correct password.  was found to be empty, then restored.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Manages MongoDB client connection and operations.
  - **Changes:** Removed the  fallback in  acquisition, and added SSL configuration for MongoDB Atlas connectivity.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Likely handles fund-related calculations and data retrieval.
  - **Changes:** Removed a  fallback in its MongoDB connection setup.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Stores frontend environment variables, notably .
  - **Changes:** Updated  from an old development URL to the production URL, and the frontend build was re-run to apply this change.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Root component, handles global state and OAuth callbacks.
  - **Changes:** Login handling () was examined for token storage.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Handles user login interaction.
  - **Changes:** Examined for correct usage of  and  prop.
- ****
  - **Importance:** Configures Axios for API calls and JWT injection.
  - **Changes:** Examined for correct JWT token retrieval from .
- ****
  - **Importance:** Primary technical documentation.
  - **Changes:** Heavily updated to reflect MongoDB Atlas usage, correct passwords, and overall system status, removing outdated references to local MongoDB.
- **, , , , , , **
  - **Importance:** Temporary scripts created for debugging, testing, and attempting to fix data issues or create investments programmatically.
  - **Changes:** These were created and modified throughout the trajectory to address specific problems (e.g., checking investments, deleting them, creating them with specific parameters, testing MT5).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the system was in a state of critical data inconsistency and authentication issues in the production environment. The AI engineer was repeatedly attempting to create four specific investments for Alejandro Mariscal. Despite numerous attempts, and debugging efforts focused on JWT authentication, MongoDB Atlas connection (where the database URL, password, and local fallbacks were incorrect/stale for extended periods), and fund minimum waivers, the system had inadvertently created 10 investments for Alejandro with incorrect aggregate values, leading to significant data corruption. For example, the total AUM for Alejandro was reported as 52,605.64 instead of the desired 18,151.41. The MT5 API connectivity, although endpoints were verified to exist, was also initially problematic. The AI engineer was unable to delete these incorrect investments due to missing/non-functional delete API endpoints and issues with direct database access. The user expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the production state, prompting a shift in focus.
