The trajectory documents a complex and iterative development process, pivoting from an automated, service-account-based Google connection to a per-user Google OAuth system based on explicit user feedback. The initial work involved migrating the application from a mock user database to MongoDB as the single source of truth.

The core of the work involved a major refactoring of the backend () and frontend to support individual admin authentication with Google. This included creating new API endpoints, frontend components (), and handling the OAuth callback flow ().

Development was punctuated by several critical debugging cycles reported by the user. Key issues resolved include: a blank admin dashboard caused by a faulty React component, persistent JWT authentication failures due to mismatched localStorage keys () and token fields (), non-functional CRM modals due to missing event handlers (), and incorrect data display.

The final phase focused on production hardening. This included migrating to a user-provided MongoDB Atlas cluster, removing all mock financial data, implementing a requested Excel export feature, and fixing a series of critical bugs found post-deployment, primarily related to OAuth configuration and client update API endpoint mismatches. The current task is to resolve an error occurring during investment creation.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS investment management platform requires robust, per-user Google Workspace integration for its admin users. Each administrator must connect their own individual Google account via an OAuth 2.0 flow. The application must securely store these credentials (tokens) to maintain the connection across sessions, ensuring seamless access to Google services like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Sheets.

This integration is central to the platform's CRM functionality, enabling actions like sending emails and scheduling meetings directly from the client management interface. The system must display the real-time connection status and data for the currently logged-in admin.

All application data, including users, clients, and investment records, must be stored persistently in a production-grade MongoDB database (now configured with MongoDB Atlas), eliminating any reliance on in-memory mock data. The admin dashboard must provide accurate, real-time financial data (e.g., AUM, cash flow) and include functionality to export data from various views to Excel.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI for the REST API.
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for the user interface.
- **Database:** MongoDB (migrated from local/mock to a cloud-hosted MongoDB Atlas instance).
- **Authentication:**
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing API endpoints.
  - Google OAuth 2.0 for individual admin user authorization to access Google APIs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a classic full-stack architecture with a React frontend communicating with a Python FastAPI backend, backed by a MongoDB Atlas database.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the monolithic core of the backend, containing all API endpoints, business logic, database interactions, and authentication handling.
  - **Changes:** Extensively modified to remove all  references, replacing them with MongoDB queries. New endpoints were added for the individual Google OAuth flow (, ). JWT creation and validation logic were corrected to fix critical authentication bugs. A missing client update endpoint () was added to match the frontend's requirements. The Google connection status endpoint was updated to use individual user tokens instead of a generic service account.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main container for all administrative tabs and functionality.
  - **Changes:** The old, redundant  tab was removed. It was updated to render the new  component. Excel export functionality was added, including a new Export button on multiple tabs (, , etc.) wired to a new export utility function.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The primary UI for managing and interacting with the individual user's Google connection.
  - **Changes:** This component was integrated to replace a simpler placeholder. Its logic was updated to use the new individual OAuth API endpoints for checking status and initiating the connection. Functionality was added to automatically fetch and display real data (emails, calendar events, drive files) upon a successful connection.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The centralized Axios instance used for all frontend API calls. It injects the JWT token into request headers.
  - **Changes:** A critical bug was fixed where the interceptor was looking for the auth token in  under the wrong key ( instead of ), causing widespread API authentication failures.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The root component of the React application, responsible for routing and global state management, including handling the OAuth callback.
  - **Changes:** The  hook was modified to correctly detect and process the callback parameters from the Google OAuth redirect, ensuring the authorization code is sent to the backend to complete the token exchange.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Stores backend configuration, including database connection strings and secrets.
  - **Changes:** The  was updated from a local instance to the connection string for the user's production MongoDB Atlas cluster.

<pending_tasks>
- **Password Security:** Implement bcrypt password hashing for user credentials, as the current password123 is a major security risk explicitly deferred by the user.
- **Implement MetaTrader5 Integration:** The  file exists but the actual integration is pending.
- **Automate Rebate Tracking:** Implement the API for tracking rebates based on trading volume.
- **Implement Send for Signature**: Add the DocuSign or similar functionality on the Drive tab.
- **Complete Advanced Dashboard:** Integrate the  component with real data.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The application is live in a production environment. Most of the critical functionalities, including individual Google OAuth, client management, and data display, have been implemented and debugged through multiple iterations with the user. The system is fully migrated to MongoDB Atlas, and all mock financial data has been zeroed out to reflect a clean production state.

Immediately before this summary request, the user attempted to create a new investment for the client Alejandro Mariscal. They filled out the investment form with an amount of 8,151.41, selected the FIDUS Core Fund, and specified Crypto Currency as the payment method. Upon submitting the form, they encountered an unspecified error, which they reported with screenshots. The current and most immediate task is to diagnose and resolve this investment creation failure to ensure the final core business workflow is operational in production.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will investigate the investment creation failure. My first step will be to examine the backend API endpoint responsible for creating investments and check the supervisor logs for any specific errors that occurred during the user's attempt.
