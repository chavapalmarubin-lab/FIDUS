The AI engineer's trajectory began with the broad task of improving the FIDUS platform, focusing on a critical rebuild of the Google Workspace OAuth integration. Initial efforts included modularizing Google services and fixing an MT5 auto-healing GitHub workflow. The debugging process was iterative and challenging, marked by several misdiagnoses, including incorrect assumptions about backend authentication middleware, CORS issues, and the existence of Kubernetes/Nginx infrastructure. The user repeatedly corrected these misunderstandings, emphasizing the Render-only deployment stack.

Eventually, the AI pinpointed the actual code-level bugs through user-provided production logs. The first critical bug was a  in , where  was not properly stored or retrieved from session data. After addressing this, a second, more subtle bug emerged: an  in . This was correctly identified as a missing  keyword for MongoDB  calls within an asynchronous context, preventing the resolution of a Future object into the actual database document. The AI has also corrected the admin email in MongoDB to . The immediate next step is to fix this / issue.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system designed to provide real-time account data. Key product requirements include:
-   **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Robust monitoring (60-second intervals), auto-healing after three consecutive failures, email alerts, and GitHub Actions workflows for automated restarts.
-   **Infrastructure Migration**: Migration to a new VPS and removal of all old VPS references.
-   **Prospects Portal**: Development of a  section for lead capture, including an investment simulator () with a dark, professional theme consistent with FIDUS branding.
-   **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: A complete rebuild of the OAuth integration to allow admin users (specifically ) to connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. This involves sending/receiving emails, scheduling meetings (with Meet links), managing events, creating folders, and uploading/listing files. The integration must ensure explicit account selection (), pre-selection using , consistent callback URIs, centralized credential management, and robust OAuth state handling with comprehensive, verifiable testing. The current challenge is to stabilize the Google OAuth flow.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, PyMongo, APScheduler, httpx, requests, logging), MongoDB.
-   **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM.
-   **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (for MT5 auto-healing), Supervisor, Render.com.
-   **Architectural Patterns**: Auto-healing, Health Monitoring, Google OAuth 2.0 (Gmail, Calendar, Drive APIs), Service-Oriented Architecture.
-   **Data Handling**: MongoDB collections for , , , .
-   **Asynchronous Programming**: Python's  for non-blocking operations.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>


-   ****: The main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates API routes, background tasks.
    -   **Changes**: Integrates  and . Added/modified API endpoints for Google OAuth, Gmail, Calendar, and Drive, ensuring backward compatibility. Critically, the middleware  was modified to exempt  from JWT authentication (lines 23964-23975). Old conflicting Google OAuth code and hardcoded URLs () were removed. Enhanced error logging for OAuth callbacks was added.
-   ****: Directory for Google Workspace integration.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes and modularizes Google API interactions.
-   ****: Manages Google OAuth 2.0 flow.
    -   **Importance**: Generates authorization URLs, handles callbacks, exchanges codes for tokens.
    -   **Changes**: Implements explicit account selection and . The  method (around line 158) processes the OAuth redirect. Defensive checks for  extraction from state were added to prevent .
-   ****: Manages secure storage and refreshing of Google OAuth tokens.
    -   **Importance**: Stores tokens and OAuth states in MongoDB, handles expiration.
    -   **Changes**: Includes  and  methods. The  method (around line 178) is currently causing an  because  is called without . Defensive checks for  and general state validation were added.
-   ****: GitHub Actions for MT5 auto-healing.
    -   **Importance**: Automates MT5 Bridge restarts.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use an HTTP API call for emergency restarts.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies.
    -   **Importance**: Manages backend libraries.
    -   **Changes**: Cleaned up Google-related packages and ensured  compatibility.
-   ****: Main React application file.
    -   **Importance**: Handles overall app structure and potentially OAuth callback processing in the UI.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to correctly handle authorization headers when a token is missing/null during the OAuth callback POST request (around line 67), preventing CORS preflight failures (though this was a misdiagnosis).
-   ****: React component for Google Workspace UI.
    -   **Importance**: Provides UI for connecting/disconnecting Google Workspace.
    -   **Changes**: New component for the modular Google API endpoints.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full end-to-end testing and verification of the new Google Workspace integration (especially frontend interaction, Gmail/Calendar/Drive functionalities beyond initial OAuth connection).
-   Deployment and final verification of the Google Workspace integration in the production environment after all code fixes are applied.
-   Implement Phase 2 and 3 of the Prospects Portal (educational sidebar, enhanced simulator, admin dashboard, lead detail pages, convert to client functionality, mobile optimization, analytics, document upload UI).
-   Complete the comprehensive system audit and verification of all data flows and calculations.
-   Fix the  in .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in fixing a critical bug in the Google OAuth callback flow. The user reported persistent callback_failed errors and provided Render production logs. The logs revealed an  originating from , specifically around line 178 within the  method.

The root cause identified is that  was called without the  keyword. In an asynchronous Python environment like FastAPI with PyMongo,  returns a coroutine (a  object) which must be awaited to resolve into the actual MongoDB document. Attempting to call  on an unresolved  object leads to the .

The AI has previously corrected the admin email in MongoDB from  to  and has implemented defensive checks and logging around  extraction and state handling to diagnose previous  issues. All old  URLs and conflicting configurations have also been removed from the codebase.

<optional_next_step>
Add the  keyword to all MongoDB asynchronous calls (, , , ) in .
