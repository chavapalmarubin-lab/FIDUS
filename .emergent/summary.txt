The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around fixing critical issues and enhancing the FIDUS investment platform. Initially, the focus was on resolving Money Manager assignments and consolidating Admin Dashboard navigation. A major effort was dedicated to the Google Workspace integration, which proved to be highly problematic due to an incorrect initial service account approach for user-specific data. This led to a detailed re-implementation of OAuth 2.0. Throughout this process, data integrity issues, particularly datetime comparisons, and persistent routing problems were encountered and debugged. The most recent critical discovery revealed that the codebase was incorrectly configured for Kubernetes, while the deployment platform is Render.com, causing widespread routing inconsistencies. The AI is now tasked with a comprehensive architectural cleanup to remove all Kubernetes assumptions.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system integrating MongoDB and MetaTrader5, designed for client onboarding, multi-account MT5 data, and a robust cash flow calendar. Initial fixes targeted precise date calculations for various investment products and a client's investment date (Oct 1, 2025). The platform required a 14-month client calendar, refined redemption logic preventing premature withdrawals, and consolidated dashboards. New features included an end-of-day Trading Analytics system and a Money Managers Profile System with a strict 1:1 mapping for 4 managers to MT5 accounts. All database queries must use  for Alejandro.

Recent critical issues involve:
1.  Client portal redemptions: Fixing  and Invalid Date errors.
2.  A broken client calendar: Addressing a black screen bug.
3.  Profile updates/photo uploads: Fixing failures.
4.  Google Workspace integration for Admin Dashboard: Implementing robust OAuth 2.0 with token persistence and auto-refresh for  (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets APIs).
5.  MT5 Data Discrepancy: Investigating a 21.88 difference for account 886528 between broker and FIDUS.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, ), MongoDB Atlas, .
-   **Frontend**: React.js (Yarn, Tailwind CSS), Axios.
-   **MT5 Integration**: MetaTrader5 Python package, FastAPI bridge.
-   **Deployment**: Render.com (actual platform), Supervisor (process manager).
-   **Google Integration**: OAuth 2.0, Google API Python Client, Service Accounts (discarded).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main FastAPI app, heavily modified for Google OAuth, removing service account logic, fixing datetime comparison in , removing duplicate endpoints, deleting hardcoded test Gmail responses, and adding MT5 debug endpoints. Has been a source of routing inconsistencies due to Kubernetes assumptions.
-   ** (NEW FILE)**: This file was created to house the robust OAuth 2.0 implementation, including functions for OAuth URL generation, callback handling (saving/refreshing tokens), credential retrieval, and authenticated Google API service builders (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets). It properly manages  and  for refresh tokens.
-   ****: Handles money manager data, supporting 4 distinct managers with 1:1 MT5 account mapping.
-   ** (NEW FILE)**: Stored credentials for the Google Service Account. This file is now irrelevant as service account approach was discarded.
-   ****: Central admin UI, consolidated MT5 tabs.
-   ****: Client portal for Redemptions, Calendar, Google Workspace, and Profile.
-   ****: Rewritten for detailed redemption schedule display.
-   ****: Fixed black screen bug.
-   ****: Admin component for Google Workspace. Updated for the new OAuth flow, including connection status, connect/disconnect buttons, displaying connected email, and loading Gmail/Calendar/Drive/Sheets data. Logic was refactored to prevent auto-loading and handle various connection states.
-   ** (NEW FILE)**: Custom CSS for tab styling.

**New Debug Endpoints Created ():**
-   **Google OAuth Debug Endpoints**: , , . These were initially added with and then without the  prefix, leading to routing issues.
-   **MT5 Debug Endpoints**: , , , , . These were also impacted by the  prefix and Kubernetes vs. Render routing confusion.

**Database Changes**:
-    collection: Stores OAuth credentials (, , , , , etc.).
-    collection: Updated admin user's email to  and managed a  flag to track OAuth status.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **CRITICAL Architecture Cleanup**: Remove all Kubernetes-specific code, comments, and assumptions from the entire codebase. Re-establish consistent API endpoint path structures suitable for Render.com deployment.
-   Verify all debug endpoints (MT5 and Google OAuth) work correctly with the established path structure and authentication after cleanup.
-   Fix any remaining issues with the Google OAuth auto-reconnection/persistence to ensure a clean disconnect and proper reconnection with the user's actual Google account ().
-   Investigate and resolve the 21.88 MT5 data discrepancy for account 886528 using the newly created MT5 debug endpoints.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical architectural mismatch: the codebase contains Kubernetes-specific configurations and comments, but the application is deployed on Render.com. This has led to persistent routing issues, especially for newly implemented debug endpoints.

In the immediate preceding messages:
1.  The AI identified extensive Kubernetes references in the codebase.
2.  It attempted to determine the correct API path structure for Render, initially removing  prefixes from debug and Google OAuth endpoints.
3.  However, subsequent testing revealed that the  prefix *is* required for most API calls (e.g.,  works).
4.  The AI re-added the  prefix to the debug endpoints and added authentication dependencies.
5.  Despite these changes, testing the  endpoint still resulted in Not Found or the frontend HTML, indicating the routing issue persists.

The current state is one of fundamental architectural debugging, trying to align the code's routing assumptions with the Render.com deployment environment, which is paramount before any new features or existing fixes can be reliably tested or confirmed.

<optional_next_step>
Conduct a thorough audit and remove all Kubernetes-specific code/comments, then re-verify and consistently apply the correct API path structure (likely with  prefix) for all endpoints.
