The trajectory details a multi-phase effort to stabilize and integrate the FIDUS platform with MetaTrader5 (MT5). Initially, the project struggled with a misconfigured MongoDB and the Windows-only nature of the  package. The AI engineer established a robust MongoDB Atlas connection and implemented a bridge architecture using a separate FastAPI service on a Windows VPS to interact with MT5.

Key challenges involved manually deploying the bridge service on the VPS due to PowerShell version incompatibility, troubleshooting external access blocked by ForexVPS firewalls, and resolving an internal Python NumPy version conflict that prevented the MT5 Python package from connecting. A significant persistent issue was Kubernetes ingress routing, selectively blocking certain  endpoints despite them being correctly defined in FastAPI. The AI also fixed a critical module-level name collision that caused initialization errors. The conversation concludes with the AI and user preparing an email to the Emergent platform team, providing concrete evidence of the ingress routing issue, and the user waiting for this platform-level fix.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for internal admin users, with four core requirements:

1.  **Secure User Management:** Admins require secure login using JWT tokens and OAuth 2.0 with Google Workspace for CRM functions (Gmail, Calendar, Drive).
2.  **Production-Grade Database:** All application data (users, clients, investments, CRM prospects, etc.) must be stored in a reliable, production-ready MongoDB Atlas cluster, replacing any local or mock data.
3.  **Real-Time Financial Data:** The platform must connect to the MetaTrader5 (MT5) trading API to fetch real-time client account data (balances, equity, open positions) for AUM calculations on the admin dashboard.
4.  **Data Integrity:** The system must enforce strong data consistency, with robust validation and duplicate prevention to avoid incidents like erroneous investment creation.

So far, a production-grade MongoDB Atlas has been integrated. A bridge architecture for MT5 has been deployed on a Windows VPS, with a separate FastAPI service. The FIDUS backend has been configured to communicate with this bridge service. Critical fixes include resolving MongoDB connection issues, a NumPy version incompatibility on the VPS for MT5 Python connectivity, and initial debugging of backend endpoint registration issues.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI, asynchronous programming (async/await), Pydantic for data validation,  for async MongoDB.
- **Frontend:** React.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas.
- **Authentication:** JWT for APIs, Google OAuth 2.0 for Google Workspace integration.
- **MT5 Integration:** Bridge architecture using a separate FastAPI service on Windows VPS to interface with  Python package.
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes ingress for routing, Windows VPS for MT5 bridge.

-   ****: Stores , , , . It was updated to correctly point to the MT5 bridge on the VPS.
-   ****: The main FastAPI application. Significant changes included refactoring to use a repository pattern for database access, integrating  for MT5 communications, and fixing  inclusion issues. Crucially, multiple MT5-related endpoints were incorrectly using  instead of , which caused 404s due to Kubernetes ingress rules. A conflicting import and module-level assignment of  from  vs  was also resolved.
-   ****: The correct MT5 service implementation that handles interactions with the MT5 bridge client.
-   ****: A new file created to act as the client for the MT5 bridge service, sending HTTP requests to the Windows VPS.
-   ****: This new directory contains the standalone FastAPI service for the Windows VPS.
    -   ****: The core of the bridge service. It was provided to the user for manual deployment on the VPS. It exposes REST API endpoints, wraps  package calls, and now includes  to improve compatibility with FIDUS backend expectations (e.g., , ).
    -   ****: Lists Python dependencies for the MT5 bridge service, notably . Provided to the user for manual installation.
    -   ****: Configuration for the MT5 bridge service (PORT, API KEY). Provided as a template to the user for manual setup.

<pending_tasks>
- **Kubernetes Ingress Routing Fix:** The Emergent platform team needs to update the Kubernetes ingress configuration to allow all  paths, not just the current whitelisted ones. This is blocking 2 MT5 endpoints from working.
- ** 500 Error Fix:** Debug and resolve the 500 error specifically on the  endpoint in the FIDUS backend.
- **CRM Client Endpoint Errors:** Debug and fix the 500 errors occurring on CRM client MT5 endpoints.
- **Integration Testing (Final):** Conduct full end-to-end integration testing once all blockers are resolved.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved resolving deep-seated conflicts and preparing the MT5 Bridge service for seamless integration.

1.  **VPS MT5 Bridge Service Setup:** The user manually deployed the , , and  files on their Windows VPS. A critical NumPy version incompatibility on the VPS (2.3.3 -> 1.26.4) was identified and resolved, making the  Python package fully functional. The service was configured for auto-startup via the Windows Startup folder.
2.  **External Access Resolution:** Initially, external access to the VPS bridge was blocked by ForexVPS firewalls. After contacting ForexVPS support, port 8000 was successfully opened, making the MT5 Bridge service externally accessible at .
3.  **FIDUS Backend MT5 Service Initialization Fixes:**
    *   **Module-level Name Collision:** A critical bug was found where  was overwriting the correct  instance from  due to a module-level variable assignment. This was fixed by renaming the conflicting variable in the older  file.
    *   **Endpoint Definition Correction:** Multiple MT5-related endpoints in  were incorrectly defined using  instead of , leading to 404 errors due to Kubernetes ingress rules. These were corrected.
4.  **Kubernetes Ingress Routing:** It was discovered that the Kubernetes ingress was selectively blocking certain  paths. While the  endpoint's routing was resolved by the Emergent team, the  endpoint still returns a 500 error, and other  paths are still blocked by ingress.
5.  **Bridge Endpoint Aliases:** The AI provided specific code and instructions for the user to add endpoint aliases to the  file on the VPS. These aliases (e.g., , , , ) are intended to improve compatibility with FIDUS backend expectations.
6.  **Current Status:** The MT5 Bridge service is running on the VPS, externally accessible, and the MT5 connection is operational. FIDUS backend has been significantly refined. However, a 500 error persists for , and some routing issues for other MT5 endpoints remain due to Kubernetes ingress configuration. The user has just received instructions to deploy the bridge endpoint aliases on the VPS.
