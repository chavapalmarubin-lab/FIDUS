The AI engineer successfully progressed the FIDUS application from its initial state by systematically addressing user requirements and emergent bugs. Key achievements include resolving persistent frontend login issues stemming from React key duplication and modal rendering problems, implementing a comprehensive client investment readiness process with document upload, and building a robust redemption system with fund-specific rules. The engineer then meticulously refined fund calculations, redemption logic (distinguishing interest vs. principal), and integrated a client-facing investment calendar. Finally, a complete fund portfolio and cash flow management system for admins, including rebate tracking and FIDUS profitability logic, was integrated. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in rectifying backend data inconsistencies and frontend UI glitches, ensuring adherence to complex financial business rules. The trajectory concludes with a request for a comprehensive production readiness test.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is a full-stack platform featuring an animated logo, dual Client/Admin login, and respective dashboards. It includes user registration with AML/KYC, client management, password reset, and a comprehensive CRM for onboarding and investor allocation across CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED funds. The system requires automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, and role-based portals. Secure document storage with Gmail API integration, compliance reminders, MT4/MT5 API monitoring, multi-currency support, communication tools, exportable reports, encryption, audit trails, and accounting/n8n integrations are planned.

Recent implementations include:
*   Refined Gmail API integration.
*   Camera capture for AML/KYC.
*   Admin CRM: prospect management.
*   FIDUS funds investment logic: 2-month incubation (no interest), 12-month principal hold (total 14 months), fund-specific monthly interest (CORE 1.5%, BALANCE 2.5%, DYNAMIC 3.5%), and fund-specific redemption schedules (CORE monthly, BALANCE quarterly, DYNAMIC semi-annually).
*   Admin-only investment creation, client view-only.
*   Client investment readiness tracking (AML KYC, Agreement Signed, Account Creation Date).
*   User creation with temporary passwords and forced changes.
*   Comprehensive redemption system for client/admin with fund-specific rules, approval process, and deposit/redemption activity tracking, distinguishing interest and principal redemptions.
*   Payment confirmation system for deposits/redemptions (FIAT wires/crypto hashes).
*   Client-side Investment Calendar displaying investment lifecycle events.
*   Admin-side Fund Portfolio and Cash Flow management: real-time fund AUM (sum of client investments), fund performance, FIDUS profitability (fund performance - client interest + rebates), cash flow forecasting, and rebate entry.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and thoroughly tested a comprehensive **Fund Portfolio Management and Cash Flow Management system** for the admin side of the FIDUS application. This involved:
- **Backend:** Creation of new API endpoints (, , ) to calculate fund AUM based on aggregated client investments, track rebates, and provide cash flow data. Fund initial AUM values in  were reset to zero to reflect dynamic calculation.
- **Frontend:** Development of two new components:  and . These were integrated into the  as new Fund Portfolio and Cash Flow tabs, respectively. The Fund Portfolio tab now displays real fund data (AUM, investors), FIDUS profitability (Fund Performance - Client Interest + Rebates), and is set up for real-time data entry for NAV/performance and rebate management. The Cash Flow tab provides an overview of money inflows, outflows, net cash flow, and a detailed redemption schedule.
The system now accurately reflects FIDUS's business model for profitability and liquidity management.

The user's last instruction was to conduct a comprehensive production readiness test.
