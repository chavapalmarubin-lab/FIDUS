The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative process focused on stabilizing and enhancing the FIDUS platform, particularly its MT5 integration. Initially, efforts were directed towards resolving MT5 Bridge connectivity, fixing an alerting system, and implementing an MT5 Watchdog with auto-healing. Early issues included GitHub Actions  errors due to an unexpected  input and a SMTP not configured warning, despite local fixes. A crucial learning point was the difference between local workspace modifications and pushed GitHub code, leading to deployment inconsistencies on Render. The user provided increasingly detailed guidance, culminating in a comprehensive strategy for diagnosing VPS connectivity and establishing fully autonomous testing and deployment workflows to ensure system reliability and reduce manual intervention. The latest phase involves removing emojis from code and implementing these autonomous workflows.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system designed for a single client across seven MT5 accounts, focusing on accurate integration of MT5 data, broker rebates, and money manager performance.

**Past Implementations:**
1.  **Phases 1 & 2:** Frontend calculations migrated to backend, field standardization ( to ), ISO 8601 date enforcement, and API structure flattening.
2.  **Phase 3 (Trading Analytics Redefinition):** Resolved critical production issues (Cash Flow /bin/bash, missing MT5 Accounts). Redefined Trading Analytics for Manager-level Performance Analysis with risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar), introducing a 3-level hierarchy (Portfolio, Fund, Manager) and a new dark-themed tabbed frontend.
3.  **Phase 7 (Final Polish):** Ensured UI/UX consistency, optimized performance (lazy loading, API caching, DB indexes), and documented Trading Analytics. Overall system documentation updated.

**Current Major Tasks:**
1.  **MT5 Bridge Connectivity Issue:** Resolved 404 errors from  by replacing an old sync script with a new FastAPI service, adding backend proxy routes, and fixing , MongoDB checks, and port conflicts.
2.  **Alerting System Fix:** Enabled email and in-app alerts by scheduling background health checks, verifying SMTP, and adding a test endpoint.
3.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System:** Implemented an MT5 Watchdog () to monitor MT5 data freshness and trigger automated VPS MT5 Bridge restarts via GitHub Actions (), with alerts only for auto-healing failures. This includes a dashboard widget.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI, , , , , ), MongoDB.
-   **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS (Responsive Design).
-   **Deployment/Orchestration:** Supervisor, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions (for VPS deployment), Render.com, PowerShell scripting (for Windows VPS), .
-   **Architectural Principles:** Backend-only calculations, API Gateway/Proxy, scheduled tasks, health monitoring, auto-healing, autonomous testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main backend FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes:** Integrated , , , and added new  and  endpoints by including . Schedules background health checks and VPS sync.
-   ****: Core logic for MT5 auto-healing.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to remove the  input parameter from GitHub Actions dispatch payload and updated to trigger  instead of the original emergency deployment workflow. Also, removed emojis from logs.
-   ****: Handles sending email and in-app alerts.
    -   **Changes:** Implicitly verified SMTP configuration for Render.
-   ****: Proxies requests to the MT5 Bridge API.
    -   **Changes:** None explicit, but its role in proxying is critical.
-   ****: FastAPI service on VPS for MT5.
    -   **Changes:** Unicode, MongoDB truth-value testing, and UTF-8 encoding fixes were previously made.
-   ****: Original GitHub Actions workflow.
    -   **Changes:** Removed  section.
-   ** (NEW)**: Workflow for diagnosing VPS connectivity.
    -   **Summary:** Used to test SSH connection, Python/Git versions, port status, and directory existence on the VPS.
-   ** (NEW)**: PowerShell-based emergency deployment.
    -   **Summary:** Provides a more robust deployment script for Windows VPS, intended to replace the previous batch-script approach.
-   ** (NEW)**: Comprehensive auto-testing workflow.
    -   **Summary:** Runs connectivity tests, deploys the bridge, verifies health, checks account syncing, triggers auto-healing, and generates email reports.
-   ** (NEW)**: Render backend health monitoring.
    -   **Summary:** Periodically checks Render backend health and MT5 Bridge status via the backend API.
-   ** (NEW)**: API endpoints for testing.
    -   **Summary:** Provides  to manually trigger the watchdog and  for current watchdog/system status. Removed emojis.
-   ** (NEW)**: Orchestrates entire autonomous deployment.
    -   **Summary:** Verifies files, commits/pushes, waits for Render deploy, verifies test endpoints, triggers the first auto-test, waits for test completion, verifies system health, and sends deployment notification emails.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Render API Key Issue:** The Render API key is not working, preventing automated addition of SMTP environment variables.
-   **Emoji Removal:** All emojis need to be removed from code files to prevent Unicode errors on the Windows VPS. This is a critical prerequisite for the new autonomous workflows.
-   **Execute Autonomous Deployment:** The newly created  workflow needs to be triggered to deploy and verify the entire system.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a comprehensive autonomous testing and deployment system as directed by the user. This involved:

1.  **Creating :** A new GitHub Actions workflow designed to perform end-to-end tests of the MT5 healing system, including VPS connectivity, deployment, bridge health, account syncing, and triggering auto-healing.
2.  **Creating :** Another GitHub Actions workflow to continuously monitor the health of the Render-hosted backend.
3.  **Creating :** A new Python file containing FastAPI endpoints ( and ) to allow manual triggering and querying the watchdog status for testing purposes. Emojis were removed from this file.
4.  **Integrating :** The new  router was included in .
5.  **Creating :** A new documentation file.

The next immediate action is to create the master deployment workflow  that will orchestrate the entire deployment, verification, and initiation of the new autonomous testing and monitoring. Crucially, prior to the *final* deployment, the user explicitly stated, CRITICAL: Remove ALL emojis from code files. Emojis cause Unicode errors on Windows VPS, a task that has been identified as pending and needs to be addressed before successful deployment of the entire autonomous system.
