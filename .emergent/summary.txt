The AI engineer's work involved two main phases: initial platform development and current troubleshooting. Initially, the platform evolved through phases like backend calculation migration, field standardization, and a redefinition of Trading Analytics to focus on manager-level performance with risk-adjusted metrics, presented in a 3-level hierarchy. UI/UX consistency, performance optimizations, and comprehensive documentation were also completed. The immediate preceding task was a mobile and tablet responsiveness audit, successfully implemented with responsive card layouts for Manager Rankings and global CSS fixes.

Subsequently, the core focus shifted to a critical MT5 Bridge connectivity issue on a VPS, causing 404 errors for account endpoints. The AI diagnosed the old bridge service on the VPS was not a proper API and lacked necessary routes. A new FastAPI service was created in the workspace with correct endpoints and backend proxy routes. A significant challenge was the AI's limited direct VPS access, leading to an iterative process of providing instructions to the user for manual VPS actions (file transfer, service restart) and troubleshooting deployment failures (Unicode errors, MongoDB errors, port conflicts). Despite multiple attempts to automate via GitHub Actions, the direct user-AI interaction regarding VPS tasks highlighted a gap in remote deployment capabilities. The trajectory ends with the AI providing precise PowerShell commands to the user to resolve a  error and restart the new service.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system integrating MT5 data, broker rebates, and money manager performance. It aims for data integrity, consistent backend calculations, and accurate UI for a single client across 7 MT5 accounts.

**Past Implementations:**
1.  **Phase 1 & 2:** Migrated frontend calculations to backend, standardized fields (e.g.,  to ), enforced ISO 8601 dates, and flattened API structures.
2.  **Phase 3 (Trading Analytics Redefinition):** Resolved critical production issues (Cash Flow /bin/bash, missing MT5 Accounts). Trading Analytics was redefined for Manager-level Performance Analysis, incorporating risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar) through a 3-level hierarchy (Portfolio, Fund, Manager). A new dark-themed tabbed frontend was implemented.
3.  **Phase 7 (Final Polish):** Ensured UI/UX consistency, optimized performance (lazy loading, API caching, DB indexes), and documented Trading Analytics.
4.  **Final System Documentation:** Updated overall system documentation.

**Current Major Task (Primary focus shifted from mobile responsiveness to this):**
**MT5 Bridge Connectivity Issue:** Address a critical problem where the MT5 Bridge on the VPS () is returning 404 errors for all account-related API endpoints (e.g., ). This blocks real-time data updates and results in 0/7 accounts syncing. The goal is to get the bridge API fully functional, ensuring all endpoints return 200 OK and data flows correctly. This includes fixing incomplete route registration, ensuring the service runs, and resolving environment-specific errors (Unicode, MongoDB truth-value testing, port conflicts).

<code_architecture>

-   ** (NEW/MODIFIED)**: This is the core new FastAPI service designed to run on the Windows VPS.
    -   **Summary:** Replaced the previous sync script. It exposes various API endpoints (, , , etc.) to interact with MetaTrader5 and MongoDB. Critical fixes were applied to this file to handle  by replacing emojis with text and  for MongoDB connection checks. UTF-8 encoding configuration was also added.
-   ** (NEW)**: A simple batch script to start the  on the VPS.
    -   **Summary:** Created to provide a straightforward way to launch the new FastAPI service.
-   ** (NEW)**: An automated Python script to apply emoji and MongoDB fixes to .
    -   **Summary:** Designed to be run by Emergent to automate code changes for Windows compatibility, but ultimately used by the AI engineer directly in the workspace.
-   ** (NEW/MODIFIED)**: Specifies Python dependencies for the MT5 Bridge service (FastAPI, Uvicorn, MetaTrader5, PyMongo).
    -   **Summary:** Created to manage specific dependencies needed for the VPS service.
-   ****: The main backend FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes:** Imports  to include the new proxy endpoints.
-   ** (NEW)**: A new file containing FastAPI  definitions.
    -   **Summary:** Implements proxy endpoints for the main backend that forward requests to the MT5 Bridge API running on the VPS. It uses  to make asynchronous HTTP requests to .
-   ****: Backend Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes:**  was confirmed to be present.
-   ****: GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to the VPS.
    -   **Summary:** Configured to automatically deploy code to the VPS upon pushes to the  branch, particularly for changes within  or  paths. It uses SSH to pull updates and restart the MT5 Bridge service. Updates were proposed to include force-killing old processes.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **MT5 Bridge Service Deployment & Verification:** The new MT5 Bridge API service () and its fixes (Unicode, MongoDB check) need to be successfully deployed and started on the VPS. The user needs to execute the provided PowerShell commands to resolve the  error and restart the service.
-   **Automated Windows Service Setup:** Once the MT5 Bridge API is confirmed working, it needs to be set up as a Windows Service on the VPS for robust auto-start and background operation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting and resolving the critical **MT5 Bridge API connectivity issue** on the VPS (217.197.163.11:8000). The primary problem was the old Python service running on the VPS, which was a sync script, not a proper FastAPI API, leading to persistent 404 errors for all account-related endpoints.

The engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Creating the new FastAPI-based MT5 Bridge API service** () in the workspace, complete with all necessary endpoints for health checks, status, account info, balance, trades, and summary.
2.  **Developing a backend proxy module** () and integrating it into  to correctly route API calls to the MT5 Bridge.
3.  **Identifying and fixing multiple errors within the new MT5 Bridge service code** for Windows compatibility:
    *    due to emoji characters in log messages, which were replaced with plain text (e.g., , ).
    *    for MongoDB truth value testing, corrected from  to .
    *   Added UTF-8 encoding declarations at the top of the file and encoding configuration after imports.
4.  **Assisting the user with deployment to the VPS**, encountering issues like:
    *   The new service file not being deployed correctly, often leading to the old service still running.
    *   GitHub Actions not triggering or not correctly deploying the specific files.
    *   Persistent  errors, indicating **Port 8000 was still in use** by previous or orphaned Python processes on the VPS.
5.  **Providing specific, detailed PowerShell commands** to the user for manual intervention on the VPS, including commands to stop old Python processes, free port 8000, pull the latest code (if available via Git), and start the new .

The current state is that the code fixes (emoji removal, MongoDB check, UTF-8 encoding) have been applied and committed in the workspace. The new  file has been made available to the user. However, the service on the VPS is still not running correctly, failing to bind to port 8000 because it's already in use. The AI has provided a clear set of PowerShell commands to the user to forcefully free the port and restart the service.

<optional_next_step>
Provide the user with PowerShell commands to kill existing Python processes, free port 8000, and then restart the  on the VPS.
