The trajectory details a multi-phase development effort on the FIDUS investment platform. Initially, Phase 1 migrated frontend calculations to FastAPI, followed by Phase 2 which standardized fields like  to  and date formats. A critical redefinition of Trading Analytics emerged, shifting from raw deal aggregation to manager-level performance analysis, encompassing risk-adjusted metrics like Sharpe and Sortino ratios, requiring a 3-level hierarchy (Portfolio, Fund, Manager).

After initial backend and frontend implementation for Trading Analytics (including dark theme styling), the AI engineer completed Phase 7: Final Polish. This involved establishing a shared UI component library, optimizing performance with lazy loading, database indexes, and response caching, and creating comprehensive user and technical documentation for Trading Analytics.

The project then moved to a final system documentation update, incorporating the new Trading Analytics system, updated API endpoints, revised architecture diagrams, and a UI component library. Currently, the engineer is commencing a comprehensive audit and optimization for mobile and tablet responsiveness across the entire platform, verifying meta tags, applying global CSS fixes, and implementing responsive card layouts for complex tables like Manager Rankings.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for MT5 data, broker rebates, and money manager performance, integrating real-time MT5 data into MongoDB. The core problem is ensuring data integrity, consistent backend-only calculations, and accurate UI display for a single client (Alejandro) across 7 MT5 accounts. The project's evolution involved:

1.  **Phase 1 & 2:** Completed migration of frontend calculations to backend, standardization of field names ( to , P&L fields, ISO 8601 date formats), and flattening of API structures.
2.  **Phase 3 (Current Focus - Trading Analytics):** Initial fix of critical production issues (Cash Flow /bin/bash, MT5 Accounts missing, incorrect Trading Analytics/Money Managers data). **Trading Analytics was fundamentally redefined** to focus on **Manager-level Performance Analysis** with risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar), presented through a 3-level hierarchy (Portfolio, Fund, Manager). The frontend was updated with a new tabbed interface and dark theme.
3.  **Phase 7 (Completed):** Final polish including UI/UX consistency via a shared component library, performance optimization (lazy loading, caching, DB indexes), comprehensive testing, and full documentation for Trading Analytics.
4.  **Final System Documentation (Completed):** Integrated all new features into overall system documentation.
5.  **Current Task:** Comprehensive mobile and tablet responsiveness audit and optimization for the entire platform.

    -   **Changes:** Added new entries for , updated  metadata, and added . Updated MongoDB component's  to include new collections (, , , ). Also updated .
-   ** (UPDATED)**: Used for API documentation.
    -   **Changes:** Added a new category for Trading Analytics with detailed descriptions, parameters, and response examples for , , and  endpoints.
-   ****: (Replaced by )
    -   **Changes:** Old version backed up. Replaced with , a tabbed interface. Implemented lazy loading for the tab content components.
-   ** (NEW)**: New components for the tabbed Trading Analytics dashboard.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented logic to fetch data, use shared UI components, and dark theme.  includes rankings, risk metrics, allocation suggestions, and charts.
-   ****:
    -   **Changes:** Removed TradingHub Gold link/badge and fixed the grid layout for fund cards.
-   ** (NEW)**: Reusable UI components.
    -   **Changes:** Created to enforce UI/UX consistency across the application.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Changes:** Centralized constants for UI elements.

    -   **Changes:** Refactored to match the dark theme and overall FIDUS brand identity.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Changes:** Created a comprehensive user guide for the new Trading Analytics system.
-   ** (UPDATED)**: Main technical documentation.
    -   **Changes:** Added a Recent Updates section, updated version/date/Table of Contents, and appended a detailed Trading Analytics System section.
-   ** (UPDATED)**:
    -   **Changes:** Added new nodes for 'Trading Analytics' and 'UI Component Library' and new connections.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement Manager-Level Trading Analytics**: While backend/frontend core is done, detailed mobile responsiveness for Manager Rankings table needs to be addressed.
-   **Fix Money Managers Page**: The initial pending task of fixing the empty performance comparison chart and incorrect manager count might still have elements needing attention.
-   **Comprehensive Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness**: This is the immediate, overarching task currently being worked on.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the final stages of a major feature development and system update. This encompassed:

1.  **Phase 7 Completion (UI/UX, Performance, Documentation):**
    *   **UI/UX Standardization:** Established a shared UI component library (, , , ) and style constants (). These were applied to the new Trading Analytics components (, , ) and critical parts of the  (removing TradingHub Gold link, fixing fund card layout), ensuring a consistent dark theme and professional look.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Implemented lazy loading for the  tabs, verified existing database indexes (, ,  collections), and added simple  for the  and  backend endpoints, improving API response times.
    *   **Documentation:** Created a dedicated  and comprehensively updated the main  to reflect Phase 7 completion, the new Trading Analytics system (architecture, APIs, calculations, optimizations), and updated overall system versioning.

2.  **Final System Documentation Update:** Integrated the newly completed Trading Analytics system, updated Money Managers and UI Component Library metadata into , added Trading Analytics API details to , and included new nodes/connections for Trading Analytics and the UI Library in .

The entire Technical Documentation Project (including Trading Analytics as a core feature) was declared 100% complete and approved by the user.

**Current immediate task:** The user then initiated a **Comprehensive Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness Audit and Optimization** for the entire FIDUS platform. The AI engineer is currently in the first step of this task: verifying foundational elements like meta tags in  and applying global CSS fixes. This involves ensuring all pages and features are touch-friendly, adapt to various screen sizes (mobile 375px, tablet 768px), and perform well on mobile networks, with a critical focus on optimizing the complex Manager Rankings table for mobile. The user specifically asked for an Option B: Responsive Cards approach for the Manager Rankings table.
