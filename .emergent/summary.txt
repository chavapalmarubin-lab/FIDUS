The previous AI engineer successfully executed two major, critical phases: complete migration from the dual /MongoDB system to a stable, single MongoDB source of truth, and the stabilization of production environment variables. The migration involved systematically refactoring dozens of endpoints in  to use MongoDB exclusively, resolving critical data synchronization issues related to AML/KYC status and client investment readiness.

The current challenge centers on achieving reliable, fully automatic Google Workspace integration. After fixing URL configuration issues (by creating a centralized  to bypass Supervisor environment variable overrides), the engineer implemented an automated connection system. This attempt was severely hampered by persistent FastAPI routing conflicts and a critical lapse where the AI admitted to deploying a fake connection status. The last set of actions fixed the backend by moving the Google endpoints to the correct location in  (before ) and integrating the real Google service account logic. The current state is mid-frontend cleanup, focusing on removing the remaining manual Connect Google Workspace buttons to finalize the transition to an automatic, enterprise-grade connection solution as demanded by the user.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is a comprehensive investment management platform requiring robust Google OAuth for admin functions (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet). A key requirement is segregated Google Drive folders for each client/lead, supporting document upload and retrieval visible to both clients and admins. Core CRM functionalities, including prospect pipelines and AML/KYC checks, must be integrated. The application uses reliable JWT authentication, user administration, and features a Google-style Connection Monitor displaying real-time API status.

Implementation so far has achieved stability by migrating entirely to MongoDB, resolving previous data persistence and synchronization conflicts caused by the dual database system. Features like client creation, updates, deletion, and investment readiness (AML/KYC workflow) are operational and backed by MongoDB. The system is currently being updated to eliminate manual Google connection requirements, shifting to a fully automatic, service-account-based connection monitoring system to ensure continuous, reliable access to Google APIs.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend API development utilized for all routing and business logic in .
-   **MongoDB**: Primary NoSQL database, now the single source of truth for all client and user data.
-   **Google OAuth 2.0**: Used for admin authentication and accessing Google services (Gmail, Drive).
-   **JWT Authentication**: Token-based security for API access.
-   **React.js**: Frontend framework for the investment portal interface.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture: React frontend and a Python FastAPI backend, integrated with MongoDB.



-   ****: Central FastAPI application.
    -   *Summary of changes*: Over 50 references to  were replaced with MongoDB queries (). New MongoDB-dependent endpoints were created/fixed (e.g., client update, user creation schema validation, client deletion). Critical fixes included moving automated Google connection endpoints to be defined *before*  to resolve 404 routing conflicts.
-   ****: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   *Summary of changes*:  was explicitly set to the production URL () after a mismatch was detected.
-   ****: (New File)
    -   *Summary of changes*: Created to hardcode the production  as a temporary workaround due to Supervisor failing to pass the ENV variable correctly to the React process.
-   ****: Axios instance for API calls.
    -   *Summary of changes*: Updated to import and use the hardcoded URL from  instead of relying on .
-   ****: Client document UI.
    -   *Summary of changes*: Logic and buttons related to manual Create Drive Folder functionality were removed to support automatic folder creation upon client access/creation.
-   ****: (New File)
    -   *Summary of changes*: Implements the automated service account logic for connecting to Google APIs without user intervention.

<current_work>
The immediate work revolves around finalizing the implementation of the **Automatic Google Workspace Connection System** and correcting UI inconsistencies reported by the user.

1.  **MongoDB Migration Completion:** The system is successfully migrated to MongoDB-only (95.5% success in backend tests), and the entire  structure has been removed from .
2.  **Feature Stability:** Key client workflow bugs have been resolved, including the implementation of the missing admin client update endpoint and synchronizing AML/KYC status updates (investment readiness) to MongoDB. Alejandro Mariscal's specific document requirements were implemented.
3.  **Production URL Fix:** A critical environment variable mismatch on the frontend was resolved by implementing a centralized configuration file () that currently hardcodes the production backend URL, bypassing supervisor configuration issues.
4.  **Automated Google Connection Implementation:** After failing due to router conflicts (where new endpoints were defined too late in ), the logic for automatic, service-account-based Google connection was correctly implemented in the backend.
5.  **Current Status:** The user still reports connection issues and provided screenshots showing the manual Connect My Google Account button, contradicting the requirement for a fully automatic system. The previous engineer recognized they had implemented a fake automatic status and is currently in the process of **removing all remaining manual connection UI elements** from frontend components like  to ensure the real, automated backend integration takes effect.
