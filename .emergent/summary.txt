The AI engineer's work primarily focused on integrating Google OAuth and various Google APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet) into the FIDUS application, along with a document signing feature and CRM integration. The trajectory highlights an iterative debugging process, starting with persistent authentication issues like , , , and . Significant effort was spent on correctly loading environment variables and updating backend authentication from session-based to JWT. The engineer systematically implemented backend API endpoints and then integrated them into the frontend UI, including CRM components. Recurring themes were frontend authentication state management, which seemed resolved but kept re-emerging, and ensuring seamless integration with existing CRM workflows. The work concluded with fixes for CRM UI elements and preparing to address missing Send for Signature functionality and CRM pipeline stages.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central FastAPI application for API routing.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to include new JWT-authenticated endpoints for Google OAuth callback, Gmail (read/send), Calendar (events/create), Drive (upload/files), and Meet (create spaces). Critical fixes involved ensuring  was called before  imports, and updating old session-based authentication to JWT for various Google and document signing endpoints. A Google Drive upload endpoint was added. Duplicate calendar event creation endpoints were consolidated.
-   ****: Stores environment variables for backend.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for Google OAuth credentials (, , ) and MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: Verified and utilized existing variables, with focus on correct loading.
-   ****: Encapsulates all real Google API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Updated for lazy initialization of Google API clients to ensure environment variables are loaded. Modified  to handle flexible Google OAuth scopes (allowing ). Added Google Meet API methods.
-   ****: Logic for document signing.
    -   **Changes**: No direct code changes were mentioned for this file, but its endpoints in  were updated for authentication.
-   ****: Main React application component.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed to correctly store the backend-issued JWT token () into  as  during admin login. This was crucial for persistent authentication. Authentication detection logic was reviewed.
-   ****: Login UI.
    -   **Changes**: Ensured  correctly passes data to  for JWT storage.
-   ****: Handles Google OAuth redirects.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to correctly process authorization codes, store  and  in , and redirect after successful authentication. JWT token handling was reviewed to ensure frontend sends it properly in the Authorization header.
-   ****: Frontend UI for Google Workspace features.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed frontend endpoint calls for Gmail (from  to ). Corrected email sending to use  instead of . Implemented handler functions for Calendar, Drive, and Sheets buttons. Added a modal for email reading functionality, including Reply/Forward. Corrected document upload to use the Google Drive upload endpoint.
-   ****: Manages CRM prospects pipeline.
    -   **Changes**: Added Google action buttons (Email, Meet, Docs, Report) to prospect cards. Implemented a prospect detail modal with integrated Google actions. Added modals for meeting scheduling and email actions. Fixed a compilation error (missing closing brace) and missing ,  imports.
-   ****: Custom hook for Google admin authentication.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for authentication state detection and improved handling post-OAuth callback.
-   ****: Authentication utility functions.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to better handle Google authentication state and retrieve  correctly.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a series of high-priority fixes and feature implementations: Gmail email reading modal, Google Drive upload endpoint and frontend integration, meeting scheduling modals, and full CRM Google integration modals for prospect cards. The engineer claimed all 4 priorities were successfully implemented.

However, the user reported new issues:
1.  On the Drive tab, the Send for Signature functionality is missing the process to ask for a document to send/upload and display it in a sent tab.
2.  The CRM Pipeline is missing its stages (the process to turn leads into clients), which should incorporate Google email, documents, signatures, and meetings.

The AI engineer acknowledged these issues and stated they would start with Issue 1: Drive Send for Signature functionality. A persistent, recurring authentication persistence bug causing the app to get stuck in a logo animation or return to login screen was noted, but the engineer believed it didn't affect underlying functionality.

<optional_next_step>
Address the missing Send for Signature functionality on the Drive tab, allowing users to select and upload documents for signing.
