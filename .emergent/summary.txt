The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has largely focused on enhancing the FIDUS investment management platform, addressing both new feature requests and critical bug fixes. Key achievements include the integration of MT5 account mapping into the investment creation workflow, a comprehensive crypto wallet system for clients and admins, and significant refactoring of financial calculations in the Cash Flow Management dashboard to accurately reflect MT5 performance and fund incubation periods. An MT5 investment validation process was also implemented to ensure data integrity.

A recurring theme in the trajectory was persistent data integrity issues, particularly accidental test data contamination, leading to multiple cleanup operations. The engineer also tackled inconsistencies in MT5 data display and the CRM dashboard. The trajectory concludes with a critical unresolved issue: despite numerous attempts and a restoration, the  API endpoint in  is still failing to retrieve Salvador Palma's investments, indicating a lingering problem with date parsing and retrieval logic that the engineer was actively debugging at the very end.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform for client/admin roles, supporting AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring.

Key requirements and implemented/addressed features include:
1.  **Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System:** Admin dashboard compares client fund commitments against real MT5 returns, correctly using total MT5 performance (profit + withdrawals) and accounting for incubation periods in client obligations.
2.  **Client Dashboard:** Displays correct individual fund balances and updated branding.
3.  **MT5 Account Mapping in Investment Creation:** Ability to input MT5 login details during client investment creation, with secure credential storage.
4.  **Comprehensive Crypto Wallet System:** New client Wallet tab for managing personal crypto/fiat payment instructions and viewing FIDUS official deposit addresses (USDT, USDC, Bitcoin, Ethereum). Includes backend CRUD APIs for client and admin access.
5.  **Cash Flow Management:** Refactored calculations to align with proper fund accounting, using actual MT5 trading profits and accurate client interest obligations after incubation. Manual lot-based rebate entry is supported.
6.  **CRM Dashboard:** Trading Monitor and Fund Management tabs now display real client MT5 data and calculated metrics, eliminating mock data and resolving broker name inconsistencies.
7.  **Investment Validation Process:** Investments require proper MT5 mapping, historical data retrieval, and start date identification, transitioning through various  statuses before  and . Admin approval is required.
8.  **Data Integrity Safeguards:** Implemented validation to prevent test data contamination.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was troubleshooting a critical and persistent bug where the  endpoint was returning zero investments for Salvador Palma. This issue surfaced despite earlier successful investment creation and verification.

The investigation revealed:
1.  A DEVASTATING DISCOVERY that Salvador Palma had zero investments in the database, leading to an **emergency restoration** of his two legitimate investments (BALANCE and CORE funds).
2.  The persistence of duplicate investments, which were subsequently identified and **cleaned up** from the database.
3.  Recurring **date format and timezone comparison errors** () within the  method in . The code struggled with correctly parsing and comparing date strings and datetime objects, leading to retrieval failures.

The engineer made multiple attempts to fix these date handling issues, including modifying the parsing logic to handle stringified dates and addressing  comparisons. The very last action taken in the trajectory was a **rewrite of a problematic section within the  method** in  to resolve the persistent  error. However, the trajectory concludes immediately after this rewrite, without a successful verification that the method now correctly retrieves Salvador Palma's investments. Therefore, the core problem of the API returning zero investments is the immediate context.
