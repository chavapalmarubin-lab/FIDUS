The AI engineer's work involved an iterative, often regressive, attempt to stabilize the FIDUS investment platform, primarily focusing on Google Workspace integration and eliminating the  database. Initial efforts fixed critical bugs (MongoDB schema, Google Drive segregation, UI/UX). A recurring challenge was data persistence due to the dual  and MongoDB system, leading to repeated client data loss and inconsistent Google API authentication. The AI repeatedly fixed and broke Google OAuth, facing ,  errors, and token storage failures, often due to inconsistent environment variable usage and hardcoded URLs. Despite several attempts to remove , the system repeatedly reverted to hybrid operation, causing user frustration. The latest phase involves a renewed, systematic effort to fully migrate to MongoDB, analyzing all  dependencies to prevent further regressions.

The FIDUS financial portal is a comprehensive investment management platform. It requires robust Google OAuth for admin authentication, real Google API integration (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet) for both admin and client portals, and segregated Google Drive folders for each client/lead with document upload capabilities. Core CRM functionalities, including prospect pipelines and AML/KYC checks, must be integrated with Google services. The application needs reliable JWT authentication, user administration, and a Google-style connection monitor to display real-time API status. Clients should also manage their profiles and upload documents. Implementation so far has addressed MongoDB schema validation, Google Drive folder creation for prospects, functional CRM pipelines, and client/user administration. Admin Google Workspace interfaces now display real data. However, persistent issues with  vs. MongoDB have led to temporary rollbacks.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical effort to resolve persistent issues related to Google OAuth connectivity and data consistency, specifically focusing on the  vs. MongoDB conflict.

The user reported:
1.  Inability to upload documents from both client and admin logins, receiving Client not found errors.
2.  The Create Drive Folder button persisted even when the Google Drive folder already existed, indicating a database synchronization issue.
3.  Continued frustration with the system's instability due to the dual database architecture ( and MongoDB).

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  Debugging Google OAuth token storage, identifying that tokens were not persisting in the database despite the Connection Monitor showing Connected. This was traced to inconsistent  usage between OAuth callback and Google API calls, and hardcoded redirect URIs in . These were addressed by updating environment variables and standardizing user IDs.
2.  Investigating Alejandro's client and prospect records, confirming their existence but noting missing Google Drive folder metadata in his database record.
3.  Attempting to manually update Alejandro's database record with folder information and programmatically triggering folder creation, which failed due to underlying OAuth token issues.
4.  Acknowledging the user's severe frustration regarding the dual database system and committing to a systematic and complete migration away from  to MongoDB.

The system is currently in a state where Google OAuth configuration inconsistencies have been addressed (client ID, secret, redirect URIs), and attempts have been made to fix token persistence. However, the fundamental problem of  co-existing with MongoDB is being recognized as the root cause of many recurring issues. The AI has just completed a detailed analysis of  dependencies, preparing for a complete migration.
