The AI engineer's work spanned initial application development and several critical fixes/enhancements. Initially, the platform was built out with backend calculation migration, field standardization, UI/UX consistency, performance optimizations, and comprehensive documentation. The focus then shifted to resolving a critical MT5 Bridge connectivity issue on a Windows VPS, where an old sync script was replaced by a new FastAPI service. This phase was characterized by iterative manual deployment instructions to the user due to limited direct VPS access and recurring issues like port conflicts and Unicode errors, despite GitHub Actions existing.

The user corrected the AI, emphasizing its full VPS access via GitHub Actions for deployment, leading to attempts to automate. However, a persistent GitHub secret scanning block (due to the  being in commit history) prevented direct pushes. Simultaneously, an alerting system was fixed by scheduling health checks. The latest significant feature implemented is the MT5 Watchdog and Auto-Healing system. While the watchdog is deployed to Render with the GitHub token configured, it's failing to trigger auto-healing via GitHub Actions due to a  error (unexpected  input) and email alerts are not being sent as SMTP is reported as not configured in the Render logs, despite earlier verification.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system integrating MT5 data, broker rebates, and money manager performance, focusing on data integrity and accurate UI for a single client across seven MT5 accounts.

**Past Implementations:**
1.  **Phases 1 & 2:** Migrated frontend calculations to the backend, standardized fields (e.g.,  to ), enforced ISO 8601 dates, and flattened API structures.
2.  **Phase 3 (Trading Analytics Redefinition):** Addressed critical production issues (Cash Flow /bin/bash, missing MT5 Accounts). Redefined Trading Analytics for Manager-level Performance Analysis with risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar) through a 3-level hierarchy (Portfolio, Fund, Manager), implementing a new dark-themed tabbed frontend.
3.  **Phase 7 (Final Polish):** Ensured UI/UX consistency, optimized performance (lazy loading, API caching, DB indexes), and documented Trading Analytics. Overall system documentation was updated.

**Current Major Tasks:**
1.  **MT5 Bridge Connectivity Issue:** Resolved a critical problem where the MT5 Bridge on the VPS () was returning 404 errors. This involved replacing an old sync script with a new FastAPI service, implementing backend proxy routes, and fixing environment-specific errors (Unicode, MongoDB truth-value testing, port conflicts) to ensure all endpoints return 200 OK.
2.  **Alerting System Fix:** Addressed the issue where health monitoring was in place but alerts were not being sent. This involved scheduling a background health check, verifying SMTP configuration, and adding a test endpoint.
3.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System:** Implemented an MT5 Watchdog to monitor MT5 data freshness and trigger automated restarts of the VPS MT5 Bridge service via GitHub Actions after consecutive failures, only alerting the user if auto-healing fails. This includes enhanced MT5-specific alerts and a dashboard widget.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The new FastAPI service for the MT5 Bridge on the VPS.
    -   **Summary:** Replaced an old sync script, exposing MT5 interaction endpoints. Important fixes included  (emoji removal),  for MongoDB checks (), and UTF-8 encoding.
-   ****: New FastAPI  for backend proxying.
    -   **Summary:** Proxies requests from the main backend to the MT5 Bridge API on the VPS using .
-   ****: Main backend FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes:** Imports , integrates the  for scheduled health checks, adds a test alert endpoint (), and integrates/initializes . Schedules  and  using APScheduler.
-   ****: Handles sending email and in-app alerts.
    -   **Summary:** Contains  class with  and SMTP configuration. Enhanced with comprehensive logging.
-   ****: Monitors system health.
    -   **Summary:** Triggers alerts via  when component statuses change (offline, degraded, recovered).
-   ** (NEW)**: Core logic for MT5 auto-healing.
    -   **Summary:** Monitors MT5 data freshness, tracks consecutive failures, and attempts to restart the VPS MT5 Bridge service via GitHub Actions () if a failure threshold is met. Sends alerts based on healing success/failure. Requires .
-   ** (NEW/MODIFIED)**: GitHub Actions workflow for VPS deployment/restart.
    -   **Summary:** Manual trigger workflow () with aggressive commands to pull latest code, kill Python processes, force free port 8000, and restart the MT5 Bridge service on the Windows VPS. Used by the MT5 Watchdog for auto-healing.
-   ** (NEW)**: Batch script to start the .
    -   **Summary:** Provides a straightforward way to launch the FastAPI service on the VPS.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **GitHub Actions Workflow Fix:** The  workflow needs to be updated to correctly accept input parameters (specifically, remove the unexpected  input causing  error).
-   **SMTP Configuration Verification:** Re-verify why Render logs report SMTP not configured and ensure email alerts are sent.
-   **Final Deployment & Verification:** Push the corrected code to GitHub, ensure the entire MT5 auto-healing system is operational in production, including proper email alerts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the **MT5 Auto-Healing System** deployment and troubleshooting. The system, comprising  and , was successfully implemented in terms of code and local configuration.

Specifically:
1.  **** was created and integrated into  to monitor MT5 Bridge health and trigger auto-healing.
2.  A  was required for the watchdog to interact with GitHub Actions. The user provided this token, and the AI successfully added it to Render's environment variables () via the Render API.
3.  A deployment to Render was triggered to apply the environment variable change and restart the backend.
4.  The AI performed several rounds of cleaning documentation and the local  file to remove the , as GitHub's secret scanning was blocking pushes due to the token appearing in git history. The workspace is now confirmed clean, but the token remains in older git history.
5.  Render logs from the latest deployment () show:
    *   The  is initialized and running.
    *   It correctly detects the  as unhealthy (Consecutive failures: 3/3 and increasing).
    *   It attempts auto-healing, triggering the  workflow.
    *   **CRITICALLY, this auto-healing attempt fails** with .
    *   Additionally, the logs indicate .

The current state is that the watchdog correctly identifies the problem and *tries* to act, but the auto-healing mechanism itself is failing due to an incorrect input parameter () in the GitHub Actions dispatch, and critical alerts are not being sent via email.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to fix the GitHub Actions workflow () to remove the reason input parameter as indicated by the  error.
