The AI engineer successfully progressed the FIDUS application from basic functionality to a robust platform. Initially, critical financial calculation bugs related to MT5 profit and loss, reserve accounting, and timeline-based performance were iteratively resolved, making the fund profitability reporting accurate. Following this, a major Interactive Technical Documentation Project was initiated and largely completed in three phases: Phase 1 established a system registry and health checks, Phase 2 created an interactive architecture diagram with React Flow and custom nodes, and Phase 3 implemented a secure, metadata-only credentials vault with audit logging. Throughout these phases, the AI demonstrated exceptional code quality, speed, and, notably, a strong security-first mindset by flagging and correctly handling sensitive credentials. The current focus is on debugging and fixing existing Google Workspace integration issues, specifically a core problem with admin user email association in MongoDB and OAuth callback mismatches.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system designed for client onboarding, MT5 data integration, and cash flow management, emphasizing precise calculations and consolidated dashboards. Early requirements included resolving client portal redemptions, a broken client calendar, profile updates, and robust Google Workspace OAuth 2.0. A critical task involved fixing a 21.88 MT5 data discrepancy for account 886528 and perfecting fund profitability calculations, correctly treating account 886528 as an interest separation reserve, and calculating P&L as current equity minus initial deposits over the contract duration. The primary ongoing product requirement is the Interactive Technical Command Center, transforming static App Documentation into a dynamic system featuring live architecture visualization, secure credentials management, API documentation, real-time health monitoring, and quick actions, with GitHub as the source of truth. The most recent priority is to fix persistent Google Workspace integration issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into fixing existing Google Workspace integration issues. A comprehensive diagnostic report revealed critical problems:
1.  **OAuth Callback Mismatch**: Backend code expected , but the environment variable had , causing 422 errors.
2.  **Multiple Redirect URIs**: Various URIs were used across the codebase, requiring whitelisting in Google Cloud Console to avoid  errors.
3.  **Scattered Credential Files**: Multiple ,  files led to confusion.
The AI successfully updated  with the correct client secret and all required redirect URIs, and improved the OAuth callback error handling in . It also configured the Google Service Account (downloaded , set environment variables like , ). The service account was tested and confirmed functional.
The most recent critical issue identified is a **wrong email association** for the admin user in MongoDB, where Google OAuth links to a placeholder email instead of . The AI is currently investigating the admin user record in MongoDB to rectify this.
