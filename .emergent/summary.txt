The AI engineer's work began by addressing initial platform stabilization, including prior enhancements like MT5 account mapping and cash flow refactoring, alongside resolving critical production deployment issues for Salvador Palma's investments. A major focus was the comprehensive lead-to-client onboarding system, which involved fixing a Convert button visibility bug for Lilian Limon Leite due to data inconsistency. Following this, a significant feature, the Investment Simulator, was developed. This included backend APIs, public and admin frontend components, PDF export with FIDUS branding, and multi-currency support. Deployment readiness involved fixing hardcoded URLs and documenting environment variables. The most recent and complex task was integrating Google OAuth for admin users to manage emails, meetings, and documents. This integration faced multiple bugs: Failed to get auth URL (JWT token issue), a blank page after Google sign-in (callback routing), and a redirect_uri_mismatch (due to an old, conflicting Gmail OAuth flow). These were systematically resolved, leading to a unified Google integration. The trajectory concludes with the AI acknowledging a persistent authentication loop and the redundancy of the Gmail Settings tab.

The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform designed for client and admin roles, incorporating AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation, automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring.

**Implemented/Addressed Features:**
1.  **Lead/Client Onboarding:** A complete workflow from public signup to client conversion, including lead stages, OFAC AML/KYC checks, and document management. This involved debugging and resolving a Convert button visibility issue for prospects, specifically fixing data inconsistency for Lilian Limon Leite in the production database.
2.  **Investment Simulation:** A new sales tool that allows leads and admins to simulate investment performance across various funds (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED). It calculates projected interest based on incubation periods and fund rules, displaying a complete portfolio overview with charts, tables, and a calendar view.
3.  **PDF Export:** The Investment Simulator now generates professional PDF reports with the FIDUS logo, an executive summary, fund breakdown, and investment timeline.
4.  **Multi-Currency Support:** Implemented currency conversion for USD/MXN and USD/EUR, utilizing daily exchange rates, integrated into both the Investment Simulator and the Client Dashboard.
5.  **Admin Google Integration:** A system for admin users to authenticate with their Google accounts to enable sending emails, scheduling meetings, and sending documents to clients directly from the application.
6.  **Deployment Documentation:** Added a comprehensive section to the  detailing secrets, environment variables, and a pre-deployment checklist for easier management.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a bug where the Google OAuth integration, despite previous fixes for  and token handling, was still exhibiting an authentication loop and failing to retrieve the admin profile. This issue was compounded by the presence of two separate but related Google-centric tabs in the admin interface: the new Google Integration tab and an older, now redundant Gmail Settings tab. The  component had recently been updated to use the new  hook for a unified OAuth flow, resolving a redirect_uri_mismatch error. However, the user reported that after signing in and completing OAuth, clicking on the authorization button within what appears to be the  tab led to an authentication loop. The AI has diagnosed this as a combination of a persistent authentication logic issue and the need to remove the confusing, redundant Gmail tab. The current task is to consolidate the Google functionality into a single, functional tab and resolve the authentication loop.

<optional_next_step>
Consolidate Google integration into a single tab by removing the redundant Gmail Settings tab and debug/fix the authentication loop.
