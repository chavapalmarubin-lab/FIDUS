The AI engineer's work began with fixing data loading issues in the MT5 Account Management System, which evolved into a UI/UX overhaul across various dashboards. A critical bug involving client data disappearance led to an investigation revealing database schema mismatches and an empty/stale production database. The user then critically redirected the focus to the root cause: the MT5 Bridge Service failing to automatically sync data from MT5 to MongoDB.

The engineer pivoted, successfully setting up the VPS MT5 Bridge with encryption and auto-restart (Phase 1). This was followed by building a robust backend API (Phase 2) to serve real-time data with health checks, and integrating this into the frontend (Phase 3), removing all mock data. A detailed MT5 field mapping for future enhancements was also collaboratively prepared. The system now reliably syncs basic account data. The immediate next step is to implement Phase 4A, focusing on collecting deal history to unlock advanced analytics and financial calculations. The engineer is currently awaiting user confirmation to proceed with Phase 4A.

The FIDUS platform needs a robust investment management system with accurate MT5 data, cash flow, and client onboarding. The core problem was inaccurate P&L. Key features already implemented include Automated Broker Rebates, Money Manager Performance Fees, real-time data integrity via VPS MT5 Bridge to MongoDB, client dashboards, and a TradingHub link.

The central development is the MT5 Account Management System: a full-stack solution for administrators to manage MT5 accounts via a data-driven admin dashboard. This involves a FastAPI backend for CRUD operations on  and  (live data), a React admin page (), and a Python Bridge () on a VPS to sync active accounts from  to . Recent fixes ensured all 7 active MT5 accounts display across dashboards, account 891215 integrated into cash flow, redundant admin tabs removed, and a major UI/UX overhaul with 6 new Recharts charts, loading skeletons, export, and animations. The system requires automatic data flow from MT5 to MongoDB every 5 minutes with encrypted passwords.

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI, , ), MongoDB Atlas (), ,  (Fernet encryption).
- **Frontend:** React.js (Yarn, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Recharts), .
- **MT5 Integration:** MetaTrader5 (Windows VPS), MT5 Python API.
- **Deployment:** Supervisor, Kubernetes, Windows Task Scheduler, Render.com, NSSM.
- **Data Management:** Real-time data sync, dynamic configuration, data freshness.

- ****: The core Python script running on the VPS, now enhanced to use  for password encryption, dynamically load 7 MT5 accounts, connect to MongoDB (), and sync real-time account data every 5 minutes to the  collection. It handles MT5 initialization and error logging.
- ****: A new batch file wrapper for the  script. This was created to resolve Python environment issues when running the script via Windows Task Scheduler, ensuring correct  and  settings.
- ****: The main FastAPI application. It now includes an enhanced  endpoint that fetches real-time MT5 account data from MongoDB, including data freshness validation (, ). A new public health endpoint () was added for monitoring.  was deprecated.
- ** (NEW)**: A new frontend service responsible for fetching all MT5-related data from the backend  endpoints. It centralizes API calls, removing hardcoded and mock data.
- ** (NEW)**: A new React hook for consuming MT5 data and health status, providing loading states, error handling, and auto-refresh functionality (every 2 minutes).
- ** (NEW)**: A React component to display the real-time health status of the MT5 sync system, showing data freshness and warnings.
- ** (NEW)**: An updated MT5 Dashboard component that leverages  to display all 7 MT5 accounts with real-time data, replacing old mock data.
- ****: Modified to remove mock data generation and use real data from the .
- ****: Modified to remove mock data functions and fetch real data for manager performance.
- ** (NEW)**: Documents the enhanced backend API endpoints, their structure, and testing instructions.
- ** (NEW)**: Summarizes the frontend updates, including mock data removal and new component/service creation.
- ** (NEW)**: A Python script to automate testing of the backend API endpoints, validating data structure and freshness.

- **Advanced Visualizations (Phase 4 remaining from initial request):** Money Managers Performance Heatmap, Fund Portfolio Account Sparklines, Trading Analytics Trade Distribution Histogram.
- **Global UI/UX Enhancements (Phase 4 remaining from initial request):** Smooth animations, accessibility, and UX refinements.
- **Copy/Apply Enhancements to Other Pages (initial request):** Extend loading skeletons and export buttons to other relevant pages.
- **Phase 4A (Deal History Collection - proposed):** Integrate  into the VPS bridge, create  MongoDB collection, implement backend API endpoints for deals and rebates, and update frontend dashboards (Trading Analytics, Cash Flow, Money Managers) to use this data.
- **Future Enhancements (proposed):** Equity Curve Snapshots, Pending Orders, Terminal Status, Transfer Classification Detail, Account Growth Metrics, Sync Status & Error Logging, Broker Costs & Spreads.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 1 (VPS MT5 Bridge setup, with automatic 5-minute sync, encrypted passwords, and auto-restart via Windows Task Scheduler and a batch file wrapper), Phase 2 (Backend API with unified MT5 endpoints for real-time data, freshness validation, and public health checks), and Phase 3 (Frontend data layer, where all relevant components now consume real-time data from the backend, with mock data completely removed, and new services/hooks/components for MT5 data, health indicators, and auto-refresh).

The system is currently operational and stable, with basic MT5 account data flowing from VPS to MongoDB, then to the backend and frontend. The dashboards for MT5 Accounts, Fund Portfolio Management (basic allocation), and Health Monitoring are fully functional. However, dashboards like Trading Analytics, Cash Flow, Broker Rebates, and Money Manager Performance are not yet functional because they require more detailed MT5 data, specifically deal history.

A comprehensive MT5 field mapping document (13 categories, 14 MongoDB collections) was collaboratively created. The AI engineer has proposed to proceed with **Phase 4A: Deal History Collection** as the next immediate step, which would unlock the currently non-functional dashboards. This involves updating the VPS bridge to collect historical deals, creating a new  MongoDB collection, developing new backend API endpoints, and updating relevant frontend components. The user has been asked to confirm this approach and timeline.
