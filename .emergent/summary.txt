The trajectory details an iterative, often challenging, journey to stabilize the FIDUS MT5 Bridge and enhance its monitoring and management. Initially, the focus was on deploying a complete MT5 Bridge with all endpoints and establishing an auto-healing system. This involved extensive debugging of GitHub Actions deployments to a Windows VPS, grappling with SSH vs. password authentication, and resolving PowerShell/CMD syntax incompatibilities. After successfully deploying the auto-healing and a Quick Actions UI, a critical issue resurfaced: multi-account MT5 balances were zero, except for the master account. This led to a deep dive into the MT5 Bridge's multi-account logic, revealing problems with password loading from MongoDB (due to DNS issues), duplicate startup events, and ultimately, a fundamental MT5 Terminal session isolation problem on the Windows VPS, preventing the Python service from interacting with all MT5 instances. The user has explicitly reiterated the need to fix this and provided comprehensive credentials.

The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system requiring real-time data and robust automation.

1.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Monitors the MT5 Bridge API, triggers auto-healing (restarts Bridge/MT5 terminals) via GitHub Actions, and sends alerts. Requires VPS-level control and auto-recovery.
    *   **Implementation Done**: Watchdog for 0% sync rate, GitHub Actions for restarts/diagnostics, initial Task Scheduler fixes, and a backend fix for zero balances. SSH setup on VPS is complete. A zero-touch auto-healing workflow () has been created, checking health every 15 minutes and auto-restarting if down.
2.  **Infrastructure Migration**: All references to the old VPS infrastructure must be removed. (No explicit work on this in the trajectory).
3.  **Prospects Portal**: Development of a  section for lead capture, including an investment simulator. (No explicit work on this in the trajectory).
4.  **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: Rebuild to enable admin users to connect Gmail, Calendar, Drive for email, scheduling, event/file management, with consistent OAuth handling.
    *   **Implementation Done**: Core OAuth flow, token acquisition, storage, frontend connection status, Gmail message bodies, Calendar events, Drive files, and disconnect functionality are operational.  errors and frontend routing were fixed. Gmail  modified.
5.  **Quick Actions UI for System Management**: Implement a new Quick Actions tab in the frontend's Tech Documentation section for direct control and monitoring of the MT5 Bridge without manual VPS access.
    *   **Implementation Done**:  component created,  modified to integrate this component and a Full Documentation tab (rendering ).
6.  **Multi-Account Balance Synchronization**: Restore proper fetching and display of balances for all 7 MT5 accounts (not just the master), ensuring historical trade data is populated. This was working previously and needs to be re-established.
    *   **Implementation State**: Identified as a critical regression. Current attempts to fix revealed MT5 Terminal session isolation (Python service in Session 0, Terminal in Session 1), preventing multi-account balance retrieval. This remains an active problem.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main API. Added  endpoint logic.
-   ****: Handles Gmail API. Modified  to .
-   ****: Syncs MT5 data. Adjusted validation for  balances to initially allow, then reject if not all accounts are zero.
-   ****: Monitors MT5 Bridge health. Enhanced  for 0% sync,  via GitHub Actions.
-   ****: React component for Google Workspace UI. Corrected API call paths.
-   ****: React component for Broker Rebates. Identified defaulting to Last 30 Days, potentially missing historical data.
-   ****: **NEW** and **EXTENSIVELY MODIFIED**. Created to deploy the complete MT5 Bridge. Initially used , changed to , then to . Switched from SSH key to password authentication. Fixed PowerShell syntax errors for ,  and . Replaced  with PowerShell's  for file deployment.
-   ****: **NEW**. Created for auto-healing; checks bridge health every 15 minutes, auto-restarts if down.
-   ****: Previously deployed Bridge. Identified as incomplete, missing  and  endpoints in deployment despite code presence.
-   ****: **MODIFIED**. Intended as the fully functional Bridge. Iterated to:
    *   Include all necessary endpoints (, , ).
    *   Attempt single-connection multi-account querying logic (background task to cycle through accounts).
    *   Fixed: Combined duplicate  decorators.
    *   Identified:  lacked passwords, causing crashes.
    *   Modified:  to run immediately on startup, then every 60s.
    *   Modified (temporarily): Reverted  to only cache the master account.
-   ****: **NEW**. Attempted version to load passwords from MongoDB and cycle through accounts. Failed due to MongoDB DNS issues and missing Python dependencies on VPS.
-   ****: **NEW**. Attempted version using hardcoded  password for all accounts. Failed  due to session isolation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the MT5 Terminal session isolation issue on the Windows VPS to allow the Python service (Session 0) to correctly connect and interact with the MT5 Terminal (Session 1).
-   Re-implement the  script to consistently fetch and cache real-time balances for all 7 MT5 accounts.
-   Verify that the backend  can correctly sync historical trade data and that the  collection is populated.
-   Fix the broker rebates calculation to accurately reflect all historical trade data.
-   Monitor that the watchdog alerts remain fixed (90% reduction).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was deeply engaged in resolving the multi-account balance synchronization issue in the MT5 Bridge. After a successful deployment of the complete Bridge and auto-healing, the user reported that only the master MT5 account showed a balance, while others displayed /bin/bash.00.

Investigation revealed that the Bridge, even with a  version of , was not populating cached data for non-master accounts. Multiple attempts were made to fix the  function to cycle through all accounts and login, but these failed due to:
1.  **Missing Passwords**: The  dictionary in the Bridge script lacked passwords for individual accounts, causing  during  calls. Passwords were meant to be loaded from MongoDB.
2.  **MongoDB Connection Issues**: Direct attempts to connect to MongoDB from the environment and even the VPS failed due to DNS resolution problems, preventing password retrieval.
3.  **Deployment Failures**: Attempts to deploy new Bridge versions (e.g., , ) using environment variables or hardcoded passwords led to the Bridge service crashing on startup or failing to initialize MT5.
4.  **MT5 Terminal Session Isolation**: The root cause of  was traced to the Python Bridge service running in a different Windows session (Session 0) than the MT5 Terminal (Session 1 - interactive desktop). This prevents  from establishing a connection.

The AI temporarily reverted  to only cache the master account to achieve a stable, albeit incomplete, state. The user has since provided a comprehensive credential and system guide, including the explicit  investor password for all 7 MT5 accounts, and reiterated the demand to fix the multi-account synchronization issue. The AI has identified that the crucial next step is to address the session isolation problem.
