The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the FIDUS platform, initially fixing MT5 data synchronization and auto-healing system issues. A critical discovery was that the MT5 emergency restart endpoint was already functional but the GitHub workflow used an outdated SSH method, which was subsequently fixed. The major pivot involved a complete rebuild of the Google Workspace OAuth integration due to prior conflicting implementations. The AI systematically cleaned the codebase, implemented modular OAuth, Gmail, Calendar, and Drive services, and resolved several dependency conflicts. When the user pointed out continued issues and lack of verifiable testing, the AI was tasked to perform a thorough root cause analysis using production logs. This demonstrates the AI's adaptability across backend, frontend, and deployment, and its responsiveness to demanding user feedback and shifts in priority.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system. Key requirements include migrating to a new VPS, implementing a robust MT5 Auto-Healing System (60-second monitoring, auto-healing after 3 failures, email alerts, GitHub workflows), and eliminating old VPS references. A Prospects Portal () for lead capture and an investment simulator (), featuring a dark-themed, professional design with FIDUS branding, is also essential. The system requires accurate, real-time MT5 account data for all financial calculations.

Most recently, a complete rebuild of the Google Workspace OAuth integration was mandated. This aims to allow admin users, specifically , to sign in via Google and integrate Gmail (send/receive, manage emails), Google Calendar (schedule meetings, generate Meet links, view/manage events), and Google Drive (create folders, upload/list files). The integration must force account selection, pre-select the business account, use consistent callback URIs, centralize credential management, ensure proper OAuth state handling, and undergo comprehensive, verifiable testing.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had completed the backend implementation for the Google Workspace integration (OAuth, Gmail, Calendar, Drive services) and introduced new frontend components for it. All identified backend dependency conflicts (e.g.,  versions,  compatibility) and internal  for  have been resolved, and old conflicting Google OAuth code has been removed.

The AI also implemented backward-compatible API endpoints in  to ensure the existing frontend could still trigger the Google OAuth flow, even if it was calling older route names. Furthermore, the admin user's email in MongoDB was updated from  to  to align with the  configured in the Google OAuth flow.

Despite these changes, the user (Chava) critically highlighted a lack of concrete verification for the fixes. The user observed callback_failed errors and CORS issues in the frontend browser console and explicitly requested the AI to stop assuming functionality, demanding a thorough root cause analysis. The AI is now tasked with accessing Render API logs, identifying the exact error during the OAuth callback, fixing it, testing it via API, and providing verifiable proof. The AI engineer is currently in the initial step of this investigation: .
