The AI engineer's trajectory involved a critical path to resolve MT5 integration issues on Render, specifically  event loop conflicts and file permission errors. The approach included introducing  for environment-aware paths and refactoring  and  for delayed MT5 service initialization using background tasks. Despite local verification, the manual GitHub upload process introduced a discrepancy, leading to a deployed code mismatch issue. While event loop errors were resolved post-deployment, MT5-specific API endpoints returned 404s because the  deployed was not the complete, modified version provided by the AI, which is the current immediate problem to solve. The user is currently assisting in manually uploading the correct files.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for internal admin users, integrated with MongoDB Atlas and MetaTrader5 (MT5). It uses JWT/Google OAuth for secure authentication. Key functionalities include:
1.  **Just-in-Time MT5 Allocation**: Backend refactoring and frontend UI for managing multiple MT5 accounts and calculating dates.
2.  **Client Readiness System**: A mechanism with an override for KYC/AML processes.
3.  **Investment Detail View**: A basic component for displaying investment specifics.
4.  **Google OAuth Persistence**: Ensuring specific admin user () authentication persists across sessions using existing Google services.
5.  **Render Deployment Compatibility**: Adapting file paths to use  for writable files in production environments to prevent .
6.  **MT5 Event Loop Fixes**: Resolving  conflicts and initialization issues for MT5 services during Render deployment.
The recent work successfully addressed the MT5 event loop conflicts and file permission issues on Render, but a deployment discrepancy led to MT5 endpoints returning 404s in the live environment.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application entry point. Fixed route order, improved Google OAuth endpoints, and resolved MT5  event loop conflicts. It now uses  for environment-aware paths.
    -   **Changes**: Imports  functions;  (now ) initialization is delayed and wrapped in a  getter, with  run as an  for background execution, preventing event loop conflicts. Contains numerous API endpoints for authentication, client management, investments, KYC/AML, document upload, Google OAuth, and MT5 pool management.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Core MT5 integration service, handling account creation, management, and real-time performance. Enhanced with connection stability, multi-broker support, and secure credential storage.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to use  in production for Render compatibility, resolving file permission errors. Includes logic for broker configuration, simulated connections with retry, and mock performance data generation.
-   **** (NEW FILE)
    -   **Summary**: Provides utility functions for dynamic path resolution based on the environment ( for Render production,  for local), crucial for handling writable files and credentials.
    -   **Changes**: Contains functions , , , , and  to abstract file system interactions.
-   **** (NEW FILE)
    -   **Summary**: Manages Google OAuth for a specific admin user (), handling refresh tokens and API interactions for Google Workspace.
-   **Other files like , , , **: Updated internal paths to use .

<pending_tasks>
-   **MT5 Integration Verification**: Deploy the MT5 event loop fixes to Render production and verify all MT5 services initialize and function correctly. (The deployment success was confirmed, but MT5 endpoints are still not accessible).
-   **Client Dropdown Fix**: Ensure the client dropdown in the investment creation form is populated.
-   **Google OAuth/Gmail API Integration**: Complete full Gmail API functionality beyond messages, and verify Calendar/Drive.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and locally verified critical fixes for MT5 integration errors on the Render production environment. These fixes primarily addressed  event loop conflicts and file permission errors by introducing lazy service initialization, background tasks, and environment-aware path management using . The relevant files modified were , , and the new .

The AI provided these complete file contents to the user for manual GitHub upload, as direct Git operations were not possible. The user reported DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS on Render, confirming that the main event loop errors were resolved and MongoDB/MT5 pool router were imported. However, a new issue arose where all MT5-specific endpoints () returned 404 errors, indicating a router registration problem in production. After investigation, the AI deduced that the  file deployed on Render was **not** the complete and correct version it had provided, as certain critical MT5 endpoint definitions and functions were missing or mismatched in the deployed code compared to the AI's provided version, even though the overall file was larger. The AI is currently attempting to ensure the user has the correct content of .
