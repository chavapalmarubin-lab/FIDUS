The trajectory details a critical period in the application's development, marked by an initial aggressive refactor that broke key UI components. This led to an urgent  and a subsequent mandate for a comprehensive Field Standardization Audit. The audit revealed pervasive inconsistencies in naming, data structures, and calculation locations. Based on this, a three-phase standardization plan was formulated: first, move all calculations to the backend; second, standardize field names; and third, flatten nested structures. The AI engineer is currently executing **Phase 1**, component by component, focusing on migrating frontend calculations to the FastAPI backend, while strictly adhering to a Functionality Preservation Checklist and a rigorous verification process using real MongoDB data. A minor but critical interjection involved fixing the Fund Portfolio page, which was showing incorrect MT5 account allocations.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system designed for accurate MT5 data, automating broker rebates, and managing money manager performance. It integrates real-time MT5 data via a VPS Bridge into MongoDB. Key features include an MT5 Account Management System (displaying 7 active accounts with CRUD), 5-minute data flow, and encrypted passwords. Phase 4A introduced deal history collection, a  collection, and new backend API endpoints with automated CI/CD. Phase 4B added 7 optional enhancements (Equity Snapshots, Pending Orders, Terminal Status, etc.). The core problem is ensuring data integrity and consistent backend-only calculations for a single client, Alejandro (18,151.41 investment across 7 MT5 accounts), and accurate UI display across all dashboards. The current project aims to standardize field names, move all calculations to the backend, and flatten data structures to prevent future development issues.

- ****: The main FastAPI application, serving as the central hub for API routes. It was significantly modified to include new GET endpoints for various dashboards (, , , ), integrating complex calculations for metrics like average investment, investment projections, MT5 return percentages, and cash flow components. Authentication () details were also crucial for debugging.
- ****: This service, imported by , was crucial for the Fund Portfolio fix. It was modified to correctly query the  collection by removing an incorrect  filter, allowing it to correctly retrieve and associate MT5 accounts with their respective funds.
- ****: Modified to centralize complex trading analytics calculations (e.g., win rate, average trade, profit factor) that were previously performed on the frontend.
- ****: Refactored to remove the client-side calculation of Average Investment (Line 407) and now consumes the pre-calculated  field from the backend's  endpoint.
- ****: Refactored to remove the 24-month investment projection calculation loop (Lines 236-246). It now fetches the  array directly from the  endpoint.
- ****: Updated to remove client-side calculations for individual account  (Line 79) and  (Lines 56-58). It now uses pre-calculated values from the  endpoint.
- ****: Refactored to eliminate 5 client-side calculations (win rate, average trade, average win, average loss, profit factor, Lines 139-148). It now fetches these metrics from the  endpoint.
- ****: Being refactored to remove 3 critical client-side calculations (, , , Lines 126, 180, 192) and instead fetch these pre-calculated values from the new  endpoint.
- ****: This component was displaying . The fix involved ensuring the backend  properly associated MT5 accounts with funds, making the frontend correctly display the allocated accounts.
- ** (NEW)**: A comprehensive document created by the AI engineer, detailing MongoDB collections, API endpoints, frontend components, and a list of 10 critical field naming inconsistencies.
- ** (NEW)**: A detailed checklist documenting all frontend calculations, display dependencies, and testing verification steps, created to prevent functionality loss during refactoring.
- ** (NEW)**: A document to record live application values before modifications, used for comparison after implementing changes.

<pending_tasks>
- **Verify Fund Portfolio Management page fix**: The user explicitly requested verification in Message 332, which was not explicitly confirmed.
- **Complete Phase 1 Final Verification**: Fully verify Component #5 (CashFlowManagement) and all other components of Phase 1 to ensure 100% functionality.
- **Phase 2: Standardize field names**: Implement the standardized naming conventions across the database, API responses, and frontend, as outlined in the audit.
- **Phase 3: Flatten nested structures**: Refactor APIs and frontend to use flat data structures instead of nested ones.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing **Phase 1, Component #5: CashFlowManagement**. This is the final and most critical component of Phase 1, involving the migration of three interconnected calculations to the backend:
1.  **Broker Interest** ()
2.  **Total Inflows** ()
3.  **Net Profit** ()

The AI engineer successfully:
-   Created a new backend endpoint  in .
-   Implemented all three calculations within this endpoint, ensuring they query **real MongoDB data** for ,  (from account 886528),  (from ),  (calculated from  volume), and  (from ). Crucially, **no hardcoded values** were used, adhering to the corrected baseline procedure.
-   Tested the backend API via , verified the response, and manually cross-referenced calculations with direct MongoDB queries to ensure accuracy. The API response confirmed , , , etc., all matching manual calculations from real data.
-   Updated the frontend component  to remove the client-side calculation logic for these three metrics and instead fetch and display the pre-calculated values directly from the new  endpoint. The frontend modification involves replacing the calculation logic with direct assignments from the API response object.
The trajectory ends after the frontend update, just before committing these changes.

<optional_next_step>
Commit the changes for CashFlowManagement, then perform the final verification of Phase 1, including Chava's Daily Check.
