The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the FIDUS investment platform, initially focusing on backend calculation migration and field standardization. A major part involved redefining Trading Analytics to focus on manager-level performance with risk-adjusted metrics, implemented with a 3-level hierarchy. This feature was completed in Phase 7, including UI/UX consistency, performance optimizations (lazy loading, caching, DB indexing), and comprehensive documentation. The current main task was a comprehensive mobile and tablet responsiveness audit and optimization across the entire platform. The engineer successfully implemented responsive card layouts for the Manager Rankings table, and global CSS fixes, confirming functionality via screenshots. The conversation ends with the identification of a critical, but separate, MT5 Bridge connectivity issue on the VPS, generating 404 errors, which is distinguished from the completed frontend responsiveness work.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system designed for MT5 data, broker rebates, and money manager performance, with real-time MT5 data integrated into MongoDB. The primary goal is to ensure data integrity, consistent backend calculations, and accurate UI display for a single client (Alejandro) across 7 MT5 accounts.
The project involved several phases:
1.  **Phase 1 & 2:** Migrated frontend calculations to the backend, standardized field names ( to , P&L fields), and enforced ISO 8601 date formats and flattened API structures.
2.  **Phase 3 (Trading Analytics Redefinition):** Addressed critical production issues (Cash Flow /bin/bash, missing MT5 Accounts, incorrect Trading Analytics/Money Managers data). **Trading Analytics was redefined** to focus on **Manager-level Performance Analysis**, incorporating risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar) and presented through a 3-level hierarchy (Portfolio, Fund, Manager). A new tabbed frontend interface with a dark theme was implemented.
3.  **Phase 7 (Final Polish):** Ensured UI/UX consistency with a shared component library, optimized performance (lazy loading, API caching, DB indexes), conducted comprehensive testing, and documented Trading Analytics.
4.  **Final System Documentation:** Updated overall system documentation to include new features.
5.  **Current Task (Mobile Responsiveness):** A comprehensive audit and optimization for mobile (375px) and tablet (768px) responsiveness across the entire platform. This includes verifying meta tags, applying global CSS fixes, and implementing responsive card layouts for complex tables like Manager Rankings. The user specifically requested an Option B: Responsive Cards approach for Manager Rankings.

-   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI, , , ), MongoDB Atlas, .
-   **Frontend:** React.js (Yarn), HTML, CSS, Responsive Design (media queries, flexbox, grid).
-   **Deployment:** Supervisor, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.
-   **Architectural Principles:** Backend-only calculations, field standardization, UI component library, lazy loading, API caching, database indexing.

-   ****: The main HTML entry point for the React application.
    -   **Changes:** Enhanced meta tags were added for better mobile responsiveness, specifically a  meta tag for optimal scaling on various devices.
    -   
-   ****: The root React component.
    -   **Changes:** Imported the newly created global responsive CSS files ( and ).
    -   
-   ** (NEW)**: Global CSS for base mobile styles.
    -   **Summary:** Created to house general mobile-first CSS rules and global fixes to ensure consistency across the application.
-   ** (NEW)**: Global CSS for dashboard-specific responsive styles.
    -   **Summary:** Created to manage responsive layouts for dashboard components like  and .
-   ****: Displays the Manager Rankings table.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to implement a responsive card layout for mobile/tablet. The original table is hidden on smaller screens, and a new  structure renders manager data as cards.
    -   
-   ****: Styles for the Manager Rankings view.
    -   **Changes:** Added new CSS rules to control the visibility of the desktop table versus mobile cards using media queries, and styled the new  components.
    -   
-   ** (NEW)**: Responsive CSS for all Trading Analytics views.
    -   **Summary:** Created to centralize responsive styles for , , and .
-   ****: Components within the Trading Analytics dashboard.
    -   **Changes:** Each of these files now imports  to apply consistent responsive styling.

-   **MT5 Bridge Connectivity Issue:** The MT5 Bridge on the VPS is returning 404 errors, causing all MT5 accounts to fail syncing. This is an infrastructure issue requiring VPS-level troubleshooting, not a code change in the current workspace.
-   **Mobile Responsiveness Refinements:** User needs to confirm if any additional mobile responsiveness refinements are required beyond the current implementations.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed a significant phase of development focused on **Comprehensive Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness Audit and Optimization** for the entire FIDUS platform. This task was broken down into several sub-steps and fully implemented:

1.  **Enhanced Meta Tags:** The  file in  was updated with comprehensive viewport and mobile-specific meta tags to ensure proper scaling and display on various devices.
2.  **Global Mobile CSS:** Two new global CSS files were created:  for general mobile styles and  for dashboard-specific responsive rules. These files were then imported into the main  to apply changes globally.
3.  **Responsive Card Layout for Manager Rankings:** The  component was significantly refactored. A new card-based layout was introduced, which is displayed on mobile and tablet viewports (under 768px width) while the traditional table view is hidden. This new layout cleanly presents key manager metrics (Rank, Name, Fund, Account, P&L, Return %, Sharpe) in an easily consumable card format, with a View All Metrics collapsible section for details. Corresponding CSS was added to  to manage the responsive display logic and card styling.
4.  **Trading Analytics Sub-components Responsiveness:** New responsive CSS () was created and imported into , , and  to ensure these sections also adapt correctly to different screen sizes.
5.  **Verification and Testing:** Multiple screenshot tests were conducted across desktop (1920px), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px) viewports. These tests confirmed that the responsive designs, particularly the Manager Rankings cards, are functioning as expected, with the desktop table hidden and mobile cards displaying correctly on smaller screens.
6.  **Documentation Update:** The  file was updated to reflect the successful implementation and verification of the mobile responsiveness features.

During the finalization of this task, a critical **VPS MT5 Bridge connectivity issue** was observed in the backend logs (Chat Message 93). The MT5 Bridge service, responsible for fetching data from MT5 accounts, is returning 404 errors for all account endpoints, indicating a service or routing problem on the VPS (217.197.163.11:8000). This issue is distinct from the frontend responsiveness work and requires infrastructure-level troubleshooting.
