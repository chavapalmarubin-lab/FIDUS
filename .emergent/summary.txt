The previous AI engineer successfully integrated Google OAuth and various Google APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet) into the FIDUS application, alongside a document signing feature and initial CRM integration. This involved extensive debugging of authentication issues (sign-in loops, JWT handling, scope mismatches) and refactoring the backend to use JWT. Frontend components were updated to interact with these new APIs and manage authentication state. The engineer also fixed CRM UI elements and implemented modals for Google actions.

The work was passed on with two pending critical issues: missing Send for Signature functionality on the Drive tab and incomplete CRM pipeline stages. The user explicitly prioritized the CRM pipeline implementation first, followed by user admin functions, and then document signing. The current AI engineer has started by analyzing the existing CRM codebase in  and  to understand its current structure and identify where to implement the missing pipeline stages.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform designed for clients and admins, featuring AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation, and real-time portfolio management. The primary goal is to enhance its capabilities through robust Google Workspace integration and advanced document handling.

**Explicit Requests & Implemented Features:**
1.  **Google OAuth Integration**: Admin users can authenticate with Google using personal Gmail accounts for consolidated access to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet.
2.  **Real Google API Integration**: Fetches and displays real Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet data.
3.  **Gmail Integration**: Supports sending/receiving emails and scheduling meetings.
4.  **Calendar Integration**: Enables creation and management of calendar events, including Google Meet links.
5.  **Drive Integration**: Manages documents, including upload functionality.
6.  **Document Signing Functionality**: Includes document upload, PDF viewing, electronic signature capture, and email notifications. The internal signee for FIDUS will always be Salvador Palma, with the client as the other signee.
7.  **Google Social Login/Signup**: Google login/signup is integrated while preserving FIDUS branding.
8.  **Admin Login Routing**: Admins redirect correctly post-login.
9.  **CRM Integration**: Google functionalities (email, meetings, document requests, reports) are integrated within the CRM workflow, specifically with prospect cards. All CRM functionality should seamlessly integrate with Google APIs for consolidated documentation.
10. **Robust Authentication**: Addressed login loops, , JWT token handling, and frontend authentication state persistence.
11. **User Admin Functions**: New request to create user administration functions for creating and managing users.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had completed significant fixes and features, including a Gmail email reading modal, Google Drive upload endpoint and frontend integration, meeting scheduling modals, and comprehensive CRM Google integration modals for prospect cards. The previous engineer stated that all four priorities were successfully implemented.

However, the user reported two new critical issues:
1.  On the Drive tab, the Send for Signature functionality is missing, specifically the process to ask for a document to send/upload and display it in a sent tab.
2.  The CRM Pipeline is missing its stages (the process to turn leads into clients), which should incorporate Google email, documents, signatures, and meetings.

The user then clarified priorities, requesting to implement the CRM pipeline first, then user admin functions, and finally the document signing feature, while ensuring all CRM functionality integrates with Google APIs. The current AI engineer has acknowledged this updated plan and has begun work by examining the existing CRM frontend component () and backend API () to understand the current structure and identify the necessary modifications for implementing the CRM pipeline stages. A persistent authentication persistence bug was noted but deemed not to affect underlying functionality at that point.
