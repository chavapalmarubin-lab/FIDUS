The AI engineer successfully progressed the FIDUS application through several complex phases. Initially, the focus was on rectifying persistent Google Workspace integration issues. This involved debugging a wrong admin email in MongoDB, resolving multiple OAuth callback and redirect URI mismatches, and fixing a critical Python datetime comparison error causing API calls to return mock data. The engineer adeptly navigated a fragmented OAuth codebase, unifying implementations. Subsequently, the Interactive Technical Documentation Project advanced, with Phase 4 (API Documentation) fully implemented and Phase 5 (Real-Time System Health Dashboard with automated alerts) completed and verified. This included building comprehensive API registries, health check services, an alert system with SMTP integration, and updating the system registry to reflect the current Render.com infrastructure. The overall trajectory showcases iterative debugging, robust feature development, and a strong emphasis on real-time monitoring.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for client onboarding, MT5 data, and cash flow, demanding precise calculations. Early requirements included client portal fixes, and robust Google Workspace OAuth 2.0. Critical tasks involved resolving MT5 data discrepancies for account 886528 (treating it as an interest separation reserve) and perfecting fund profitability. The primary ongoing product requirement is the Interactive Technical Command Center, transforming static documentation into a dynamic system featuring live architecture visualization, secure credentials, API documentation, real-time health monitoring, and quick actions, with GitHub as source of truth. Most recently, the AI engineer tackled persistent Google Workspace integration issues and then implemented Phase 4 (API Documentation) and Phase 5 (Real-Time System Health Dashboard with automated email alerts).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 5 of the Interactive Technical Command Center project, which involved implementing a **Real-Time System Health Dashboard with an automated Alert and Notification System**.

This entailed:
1.  **Backend Health Checks ()**: Created 7 health check endpoints for Frontend, Backend, Database, MT5 Bridge, Google APIs, GitHub, and Render Platform. These endpoints measure response times, status, and track historical data.
2.  **Alert Service ()**: Developed a comprehensive alert system to trigger , , and  alerts. This service can  history in MongoDB, , and  via SMTP.
3.  **Alert Integration**: Integrated the alert triggering logic into  to compare current and previous component statuses, sending appropriate alerts for degradation or recovery.
4.  **Alert Management Endpoints**: Added API endpoints to  for retrieving (, ), acknowledging (), and managing in-app notifications (, ).
5.  **Frontend Dashboard (, )**: Developed the main dashboard and individual metric cards to display real-time health statuses, response times, and uptime percentages for all components, integrated as a new tab in .
6.  **SMTP Configuration and Debugging**: Configured SMTP credentials in  (SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_APP_PASSWORD, ALERT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL). A test email script () was created and debugged (requiring  in the script itself). The test successfully sent an email, confirming the alert system's functionality.

The monitoring system is now fully operational and production-ready, sending automated email alerts.
