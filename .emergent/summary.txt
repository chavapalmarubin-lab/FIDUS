The AI engineer's work primarily focused on integrating Google OAuth and various Google APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet) into the FIDUS application. This involved extensive debugging of persistent login loops, frontend loading issues, and UI styling. Initial attempts involved fixing  syntax errors and resolving a  error for  that caused session breaks. A major turning point was the user's extreme frustration leading to a complete overhaul: all existing Google OAuth code was deleted. The subsequent effort was dedicated to implementing a REAL Google OAuth flow from scratch, handling service account credentials, and later shifting to standard OAuth 2.0 with client ID/secret. The trajectory concluded with the successful establishment of a functional Google API integration for Gmail, Calendar, and Drive, along with CRM integration, and the user requesting a Google-style connection monitor. Session persistence issues were a recurring challenge throughout.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a major overhaul of the Google integration after the user expressed extreme dissatisfaction with previous attempts. All prior Google OAuth-related code was removed. A REAL Google OAuth flow was then implemented from scratch, requiring the user's Google Cloud Client ID and Client Secret. This new setup successfully generates a real Google OAuth URL, redirecting users to  for authentication. The frontend component  was created to provide a comprehensive Google Workspace experience, including Gmail, Calendar, and Drive interfaces, which were then integrated into the Admin Dashboard. Additionally, Google API integration was added to  to link CRM actions to Google services. The latest user feedback indicates that the Google integration is now WORKING for sending emails and accessing real Google services, and the UI is clean and beautiful. The final explicit request was to create a Google-style connection monitor and clean interface for FIDUS matching Google's design.
