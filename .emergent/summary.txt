The AI engineer successfully transformed a problematic MVP application into a more robust and feature-rich platform. The trajectory highlights a systematic approach to debugging and feature development. Initial efforts focused on critical frontend stability (login, logo animation, dashboard rendering) and resolving backend data inconsistencies (mock data vs. MongoDB). Key achievements include a comprehensive client onboarding process with document OCR and KYC/AML, robust fund calculation and redemption logic, and seamless client-to-CRM lead integration. Significant time was spent fixing  errors across numerous frontend components and ensuring correct financial calculations. The final phase introduced advanced features like dynamic logo styling and initiated MT5 integration. The engineer consistently used testing agents and troubleshooting tools to diagnose and rectify complex issues, ensuring adherence to user-defined business rules and data integrity. The work concluded with the planning of MT5 integration.

The FIDUS financial portal is a full-stack platform with an animated logo, dual Client/Admin login, and role-based dashboards. It supports user registration (AML/KYC), client management, password reset, and a CRM for investor allocation across CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, and UNLIMITED funds. The system requires automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, secure document storage with Gmail API, compliance, MT4/MT5 API monitoring, multi-currency support, communication tools, exportable reports, encryption, audit trails, and accounting/n8n integrations.

**Recent Implementations:**
- Refined Gmail API and camera capture for AML/KYC.
- Admin CRM with prospect management.
- Detailed FIDUS funds investment logic (2-month incubation without interest, 12-month commitment, monthly simple interest, fund-specific redemption schedules, minimum investments).
- Admin-only investment creation, client view-only.
- Client investment readiness tracking (AML KYC, Agreement Signed, Account Creation Date).
- User creation with temporary passwords and forced changes.
- Comprehensive client/admin redemption system with approval, activity tracking, distinguishing interest/principal.
- Payment confirmation for deposits/redemptions.
- Client-side Investment Calendar.
- Admin-side Fund Portfolio and Cash Flow management (real-time AUM, performance, FIDUS profitability, forecasting, rebate entry).
- Transitioned backend from mock data to MongoDB for authentication, client, and investment endpoints.
- Client registration auto-adds to CRM leads.
- CRM now has document capabilities for Proof of Residence and other AML/KYC.

Immediately before this summary request (Chat Message 462), the AI engineer was tasked with implementing MT5 integration. The user provided detailed requirements for this integration: one MT5 account per client per fund (max 4 per client), existing funds in the same fund add to the existing MT5 account, new funds in different funds create a new MT5 account, and only admins see real-time MT5 performance while clients see fund commitments. The engineer successfully used the  tool to obtain comprehensive MT5 API integration guidance and acknowledged the plan to implement the system according to the specified logic.
