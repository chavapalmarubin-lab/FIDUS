The previous AI engineerâ€™s trajectory outlines a complex, iterative development process focused on stabilizing Google Workspace integration and enhancing MT5 auto-healing. Initially, the engineer fixed critical  errors and frontend routing for Google OAuth. Subsequent user feedback revealed deeper issues with Google API calls (Gmail content, Calendar/Drive 404s) and a persistent  in Gmail, which were systematically addressed by correcting parameters, API call formats, and frontend URL prefixes.

A significant pivot occurred with the MT5 auto-healing, which consistently failed to restore trading terminal connections, leading to /bin/bash balances. The AI proposed a robust GitHub Actions-driven full restart system. This exposed limitations in direct VPS interaction, leading to a collaborative approach where the AI generated remote deployment scripts and workflows, and the user handled initial manual VPS setup. Despite progress, persistent MT5 connection issues (IPC timeout, Unicode errors) and Task Scheduler misconfigurations surfaced, requiring further remote diagnostic and configuration fixes. The current task is addressing these remaining MT5 Bridge stability issues.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system designed for real-time account data and robust automation.
1.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Monitors MT5 Bridge API for failures (e.g., /bin/bash balances or bridge unavailability), triggers auto-healing via GitHub Actions (restarting Bridge and MT5 terminals), and sends email alerts. Requires robust VPS-level control and automatic recovery without manual intervention.
2.  **Infrastructure Migration**: All references to the old VPS infrastructure must be removed.
3.  **Prospects Portal**: Development of a  section for lead capture, including an investment simulator with a dark, professional theme.
4.  **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: A complete rebuild to enable admin users (specifically ) to connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive for email, meeting scheduling, event management, and file operations. This includes explicit account selection,  pre-selection, consistent callback URIs, centralized credential management, and robust OAuth state handling. Currently, the core OAuth flow, token acquisition, storage, frontend connection status display, Gmail message bodies, Calendar events, Drive files, and disconnect functionality are all operational.

    -   **Changes**: Fixed  call parameters to resolve . Removed a duplicate  method to ensure proper token revocation.
-   ****: Handles Google Gmail API interactions.
    -   **Importance**: Fetches and parses email messages.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  function (line 145) from  to  and added logic to extract full message bodies from the API response.
-   ****: Manages automated data synchronization with MT5 accounts.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for fetching real-time trading data.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted data validation logic to correctly handle and allow  balances when the MT5 terminals are disconnected, enabling auto-healing detection.
-   ****: Monitors MT5 Bridge health and triggers recovery actions.
    -   **Importance**: Core component of the MT5 auto-healing system.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced  to detect a 0% sync rate (all accounts showing /bin/bash balances) as a trigger for a full system restart, and  now dispatches a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow.

    -   **Changes**: Created to allow remote intervention for VPS-related issues.
-   ****: GitHub Actions workflow addressing MT5 Bridge user session issues.
    -   **Importance**: Aims to resolve the IPC timeout by configuring the MT5 Bridge Task Scheduler entry to run as Administrator in the correct user session.
    -   **Changes**: Created to automate the Task Scheduler configuration on the VPS.
-   ****: Python script for VPS-side MT5 restart logic.
    -   **Importance**: Contains the actual commands to shut down, kill, restart MT5 terminals, and re-initialize the Bridge API.
    -   **Changes**: Created to be deployed once on the Windows VPS.
-   ****: Python diagnostic script for MT5 connection issues.
    -   **Importance**: Aids in diagnosing IPC timeout errors and verifying the MetaTrader5 Python library's ability to connect to terminals.
    -   **Changes**: Created for remote execution on the VPS for troubleshooting.

<pending_tasks>
-   Remove Unicode characters (emojis/special characters) from all log messages within  to prevent service crashes.
-   Configure the MT5 Bridge service's Task Scheduler task on the VPS to run as Administrator, only when user is logged on (Interactive logon), to resolve session-related IPC timeout issues.
-   Verify that the MT5 Allow algorithmic trading setting persists across restarts, and document this as a critical startup check.
-   Create a health check that specifically verifies the MT5 connection to the terminal on startup of the Bridge service.
-   Test the auto-start of the Bridge service after a VPS reboot to ensure complete automation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was focused on resolving the persistent MT5 Bridge connection issues that resulted in the dashboard showing /bin/bash balances despite the MT5 terminal running on the VPS. The core problem was identified as an  error when the Python MetaTrader5 library tried to connect to the terminal, rooted in the Bridge service not running in the same user session as the MT5 terminal.

The AI engineer developed and pushed to GitHub a workflow () and documentation () intended to automate the Task Scheduler configuration on the VPS to resolve this session conflict.

However, the user has subsequently outlined three new critical issues that need immediate attention to make the MT5 Bridge fully automatic and stable:
1.  **Unicode Logging Crash**: The  service crashes on startup due to Unicode characters in log messages, preventing it from starting reliably.
2.  **Task Scheduler Configuration**: The existing Task Scheduler setup for the MT5 Bridge is incorrect and needs to be properly configured to auto-start as Administrator in the user's logged-on session.
3.  **MT5 Settings Persistence**: The Allow algorithmic trading setting in the MT5 terminal was manually enabled but its persistence across restarts is uncertain and needs verification/documentation.

The AI is now beginning to address the highest priority task: fixing the Unicode logging crash in the  file.
