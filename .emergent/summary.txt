The AI engineer's work evolved through several distinct phases. Initially, it involved summarizing prior enhancements to the FIDUS platform, including MT5 account mapping, crypto wallet system, and cash flow calculation refactoring. The first explicit user request in this trajectory was to update documentation, which was completed with version v2.0.0. This was followed by an immediate deployment request, which uncovered critical production data and configuration issues related to Salvador Palma's investments and MT5 accounts, leading to extensive debugging of database access, environment variables, and API integration. After resolving these, the focus shifted entirely to building a comprehensive client/prospect/lead onboarding system with AML/KYC checks and a pipeline. The trajectory concludes with debugging a persistent Convert button visibility issue for a prospect (Lilian Limon Leite), attributed to data inconsistency in the production database.

3.  **MT5 Account Mapping in Investment Creation:** Allows input of MT5 login details during investment creation with secure storage.
4.  **Comprehensive Crypto Wallet System:** Client Wallet tab for managing personal crypto/fiat payment instructions and viewing FIDUS official deposit addresses. Backend CRUD APIs for wallet management.
5.  **Cash Flow Management:** Refactored calculations using actual MT5 trading profits and accurate client interest obligations after incubation, supporting manual lot-based rebate entry.
6.  **CRM Dashboard:** Trading Monitor and Fund Management tabs display real client MT5 data and calculated metrics, resolving mock data and broker inconsistencies.
7.  **Investment Validation Process:** Investments require MT5 mapping, historical data, and start date identification, progressing through PENDING statuses to VALIDATED, ACTIVE/INCUBATING with admin approval.
8.  **Data Integrity Safeguards:** Implemented validation to prevent test data contamination.
9.  **Lead/Client Onboarding (New Feature):** Comprehensive workflow including a public signup form, lead stages (Lead, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Won, Lost), OFAC AML/KYC checks, document management, and conversion of 'Won' prospects to clients, visible in the admin CRM.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting a persistent issue where the Convert button for a prospect in the Won stage was not visible in the CRM Dashboard's Pipeline tab. This was for Lilian Limon Leite, who had completed AML/KYC checks.

The investigation revealed that Lilian's prospect data was in an inconsistent state in the production database: , , and critically, . The system requires , , and  for the Convert button to appear. The root cause was identified as Lilian being incorrectly marked as converted to a client, while the actual client record did not exist, leading to a logical mismatch preventing the button's display. The AI engineer was preparing to fix this data inconsistency directly in the production database.
