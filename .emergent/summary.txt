The previous AI engineer focused on two main areas: initially, resolving critical MT5 Auto-Healing System issues, and subsequently developing a Prospects Portal. The auto-healing system faced MT5 connection problems and lacked a configured  for full functionality. The Prospects Portal involved building a lead capture frontend and backend, integrating with an existing simulator. A critical backend bug where new leads were incorrectly inserted into the  collection instead of a  collection was fixed.

The subsequent work involved integrating these new leads into the existing CRM system, requiring significant backend modifications in  to merge data, manage lead migration, and enforce stage validation. After successfully implementing these backend fixes, the focus shifted to a major frontend redesign of the Prospects Portal. However, this redesign encountered persistent local webpack caching and routing issues, preventing the new UI from rendering. This prompted a pivot to addressing a critical MT5 data synchronization failure, where the VPS-side bridge was reporting zero balances due to a missing  call for the master account. A fix for this has just been provided.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for MT5 accounts. The initial objective was to migrate to a new VPS, implement an MT5 Auto-Healing System (monitoring every 60 seconds, auto-healing after 3 failures, GitHub workflows, email alerts), and remove old VPS references.

Subsequently, the priority shifted to developing a Prospects Portal (). This portal needs a two-field form (email + phone) for lead capture, storing them in a  MongoDB collection (with ), and immediately redirecting to an existing investment simulator (). The design must match the existing dark theme and include the FIDUS logo. Future phases include an educational sidebar, enhanced simulator, and an admin panel for lead management and Convert to Client functionality (including AML/KYC process and activity tracking). A critical, recent requirement is accurate, real-time MT5 account data synchronization for the entire application.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, PyMongo), MongoDB.
-   **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM, styled-components (implied by design snippets).
-   **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (PowerShell), Render.com, Supervisor, Windows VPS.
-   **Architectural Patterns**: Auto-healing, Health Monitoring, API Gateway/Proxy, CRM pipeline, Data persistence.
-   **Data Handling**: UUIDs for IDs, MongoDB  and  collections.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Handles core API logic, including CRM, prospects, and client conversion.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  (GET/PUT) to merge  and  data, handle lead migration, add  flag, and implement stage validation. New  endpoint added. AML/KYC and convert endpoints updated to handle  IDs and link data correctly.
-   ****: Main React application, handles routing and authentication.
    -   **Importance**: Controls which components are rendered based on routes and user authentication status.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to incorporate  component and handle its routing. Several attempts were made to bypass the authentication check for the  route, encountering persistent local caching issues.
-   ****: (Now reflects  content) Frontend component for lead capture.
    -   **Importance**: The primary interface for lead generation.
    -   **Changes**: Completely redesigned with a professional, multi-section layout matching FIDUS branding (dark theme, specific colors). Includes hero, lead capture form, value propositions, fund showcase, how-it-works, social proof, final CTA, and footer. Phone validation was made more flexible, and MT5 references were replaced with portal de cliente.
-   ****: FastAPI service on Windows VPS.
    -   **Importance**: Acts as a bridge between the backend and MT5 terminal for live data.
    -   **Changes**: A fixed version () was created. It includes  call for the master account (886557) in the  and  functions to ensure proper MT5 account authentication and live data retrieval.
-   ****: Monitors MT5 Bridge health.
    -   **Importance**: Core of the auto-healing system.
    -   **Changes**: Discovered to be failing due to an unconfigured , preventing automated restarts.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete automated execution of the MT5 auto-healing system (requires  setup on VPS).
-   Remove the temporary  endpoint from  for security.
-   Verify all documentation updates are correctly rendered in the frontend.
-   Remove any remaining old VPS references ().
-   Perform Kubernetes cleanup (remove  from MongoDB Atlas network access if unused).
-   Resolve frontend routing and caching issues preventing the new Prospects Portal design from displaying locally/in dev environment.
-   Implement Phase 2 and 3 of the Prospects Portal (educational sidebar, enhanced simulator, admin dashboard, lead detail pages, convert to client functionality, mobile optimization, analytics, document upload UI, Convert to Client/Mark as Won buttons in CRM UI).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical MT5 data synchronization failure. The MT5 bridge service, running on the Windows VPS, was returning  for all account balances, leading to Suspicious balance change validation errors in the backend and stale data in the client portal. This issue was diagnosed as the Python  failing to explicitly log into the master MT5 account (886557) using  after . The watchdog detected the problem but could not resolve the authentication issue nor trigger auto-healing due to a missing .

The AI engineer has created a fixed version of the VPS service file, , which integrates the  call within the  and  functions. This modification ensures the master account is properly authenticated with the MT5 terminal to retrieve live data. The user has been instructed to copy this updated file to the VPS, replace the existing , and restart the Python service.

Instruct the user to copy  to the VPS, replace the existing service file, and restart the Python service.
