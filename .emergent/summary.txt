The trajectory outlines an iterative development process by an AI engineer addressing critical data integration and display issues within the FIDUS platform, initially built by a previous AI. The work began by rectifying a field name mismatch between the MT5 Bridge Service and the FIDUS backend, compounded by client ID mapping errors and duplicate investment records. This led to a series of backend API adjustments and frontend component fixes for various dashboards. Persistent user feedback, often accompanied by screenshots, highlighted ongoing data inconsistencies and JavaScript runtime errors, prompting a systematic debugging approach. The latest phase involved implementing a cash flow calendar, which, after initial deployment, was found to have fundamentally incorrect date calculation logic, leading to the current task of rectifying these calculations based on detailed product specifications.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system integrating MongoDB Atlas and MetaTrader5 (MT5) with JWT/Google OAuth. The primary goal was to onboard Alejandro Mariscal, requiring client record creation (), two investments (BALANCE 00,000, CORE 8,151.41), and four MT5 accounts. A key architectural decision was the development of a multi-account sequential login solution for MT5 to overcome its single-session limitation. Implementation focused on ensuring live MT5 data flowed into MongoDB and was correctly displayed on the frontend, especially for Alejandro's dashboard. Subsequent requirements focused on data consistency across various admin dashboards (CRM, Fund vs MT5 Analysis, Cash Flow Management, MT5 Account Dashboard), including proper calculation of fund assets, net profitability, and the integration of a separation account (). Most recently, the critical requirement is to implement a dynamic, accurate cash flow calendar showing month-by-month obligations based on precise incubation periods, first payment timing, and intervals for CORE, BALANCE, and DYNAMIC products.

    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application handling API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive refactoring of MT5, investment, and fund portfolio related endpoints (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , , ). Changes included correcting field name mismatches (e.g.,  to ), fixing datetime comparison, handling MongoDB  serialization, integrating real MT5 data instead of mock services/hardcoded values, correcting AUM calculation logic (removing double-counting), and implementing new date calculation logic for the cash flow calendar. New functions like  and  were introduced.

<pending_tasks>
- Correct the date calculation logic for the Cash Flow Calendar in the backend. This involves correctly calculating incubation periods, first payment dates, subsequent payment intervals, and contract end dates for CORE, BALANCE, and DYNAMIC products.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented a Cash Flow Obligations Calendar and integrated it into the frontend. However, the user identified a critical issue: the payment dates and intervals displayed in the calendar were completely wrong. The AI engineer is currently in the process of rectifying this. The precise problem is that the previously implemented date calculation logic for investment payments (incubation period, first payment, subsequent payments, contract end) does not adhere to the specified business rules for FIDUS CORE, BALANCE, and DYNAMIC products. The user has provided detailed rules and examples for these calculations, including a universal 60-day incubation, specific first payment timings (Day 90 for CORE, Day 150 for BALANCE, Day 240 for DYNAMIC), and consistent payment intervals (30, 90, 180 days respectively). The AI engineer has just confirmed Alejandro's investment date as October 8, 2025, and has begun to completely rewrite the backend date calculation functions to align with these detailed product specifications.

<optional_next_step>
Correct Alejandro's investment date in the database to October 1st, 2025, and then test the rewritten date calculation logic by invoking the cash flow calendar endpoint.
