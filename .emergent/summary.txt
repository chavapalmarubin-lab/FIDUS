The AI engineer successfully progressed the FIDUS application from its MVP state through several critical phases. Initially, the core task involved re-implementing a disabled authentication middleware, which was solved by introducing a robust JWT-based system and updating both backend and frontend components. This led to comprehensive API client updates across the frontend. Subsequently, a critical UX bug (missing CSS import) and recurring database errors in the Cash Flow section were identified and fixed. A major feature addition was the multi-broker MT5 integration, supporting DooTechnology alongside Multibank, with detailed admin management, real-time data collection, and display of actual trading metrics. The system was meticulously debugged for data consistency, particularly for Salvador Palma's investment, culminating in a real-time MT5 data pipeline. The current work focuses on building a Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System for the admin portal.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform featuring client/admin roles, AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, secure document storage, MT4/MT5 API monitoring, multi-currency support, communication tools, and reporting. Recent focus areas included refining AML/KYC, CRM with prospect management, fund investment logic, client readiness, redemption systems, payment confirmation, investment calendars, fund portfolio/cash flow management, MongoDB migration, and CRM document capabilities.

The trajectory highlights these additional requirements and implementations:
1.  **Robust Authentication**: Secure the application with a working authentication system that integrates with the existing frontend.
2.  **UX Consistency**: Resolve visual inconsistencies and ensure a professional user experience.
3.  **Database Stability**: Eliminate all database-related errors, especially for critical sections like Cash Flow.
4.  **Multi-Broker MT5 Integration**: Expand MT5 support beyond Multibank to include new brokers like DooTechnology, allowing admin management of client MT5 mappings.
5.  **Real-Time MT5 Data**: Implement a system for collecting and displaying real-time MT5 trading data, including balance, equity, P&L, and trading activity.
6.  **Fund Performance Management**: Create an internal system and admin dashboard to compare FIDUS client fund commitments against real-time MT5 returns.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on creating an internal management system that compares the FIDUS client commitment VS the MT5 returns on a real-time basis for the admin portal.

The user's explicit request was: FIDUS has four funds for clients to select and the FIDUS admin portal has to be able to manage the difference between the FUND commitments and the MT5 real time data balances and equity of each account the salvador palma account from the client perspective is a BALANCE fund which pays as we know 2.5% monthly with redemptions every 3 months we have to create an internal management system that compares the FIDUS client commitment VS the MT5 returns on a real time basis and give the FIDUS admin portal the dashboard it needs to compare both and make decisions.

In response, the AI engineer has taken the following steps:
1.  **Created **: This new Python file is intended to house the core logic for the fund performance comparison.
2.  **Added API Endpoints**: Modified  to include new API endpoints that will serve data for this fund management system.
3.  **Created **: This new React component will serve as the user interface for the admin portal's fund performance dashboard.
4.  **Prepared to integrate into AdminDashboard**: The last action was to add this new  to the  navigation.

The current state is that the foundational files and API endpoints for this new feature are in place, but the core comparison logic and the full integration into the Admin Dashboard's UI are still in progress.
