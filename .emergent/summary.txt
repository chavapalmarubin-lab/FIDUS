The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the FIDUS financial portal, transitioning it from an MVP to a more robust, production-ready application. Key achievements include the successful integration of a JWT-based authentication system, addressing crucial UX and database stability issues, and implementing a multi-broker MT5 integration for real-time data collection. A significant feature developed was the Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System, enabling admins to compare client fund commitments against actual MT5 performance. This involved extensive debugging of data sources, calculation logic (including crucial corrections for simple interest and MT5 actual return formula), and ensuring proper client-admin data separation. The UI was also refined, including a comprehensive calendar view and consistent logo branding. The last identified task is a critical production database error related to missing real-time MT5 data for Salvador Palma's accounts.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform supporting client/admin roles, AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring. The recent development trajectory focused on:

1.  **Robust Authentication**: Re-implementing a secure, JWT-based authentication for both backend and frontend.
2.  **UX Consistency & Database Stability**: Fixing critical UI bugs (CSS import) and recurring database errors, especially in Cash Flow, and enhancing error handling.
3.  **Multi-Broker MT5 Integration**: Extending MT5 support to include DooTechnology alongside Multibank, with admin management of client MT5 mappings.
4.  **Real-Time MT5 Data**: Establishing a system for collecting, storing, and displaying live MT5 trading data (balance, equity, P&L).
5.  **Fund Performance Management**: Creating an internal system and admin dashboard to compare FIDUS client fund commitments against real-time MT5 returns, including accurate calculation based on MT5 deposit date, actual profit + withdrawal + current balance, and simple interest.
6.  **Client Dashboard Refinements**: Displaying correct fund balances, enhancing the investment calendar view, and streamlining the navigation.
7.  **Consistent Branding**: Implementing a new FIDUS logo consistently across the application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was in the process of preparing the application for production deployment. The user explicitly stated: we had deployed already and you were fixing a database error due to non MT5 real time data from two accounts for salvador palma Doo and VT.

This indicates that a critical production-level bug has been reported: Salvador Palma's MT5 accounts from DooTechnology and VT are experiencing data feeding issues, resulting in non-real-time data and causing database errors. The AI engineer has acknowledged this as a critical bug requiring immediate attention.

The previous work involved:
1.  **Fund Performance Management System**: This system is now functional, correctly calculates performance gaps using MT5 data, simple interest, and a start date derived from MT5 records.
2.  **Client Dashboard**: Displaying correct fund balances and an enhanced calendar.
3.  **Logo Implementation**: New FIDUS logo successfully integrated and correctly sized in all relevant parts of the application.
4.  **MT5 Data Source**: The system currently relies on manually updated MT5 account records in MongoDB (populated based on user-provided screenshot data and specific deposit date instructions) rather than a live MetaTrader5 API connection due to environmental limitations (MetaTrader5 package not installable).

The immediate focus shifted to addressing the critical real-time data flow issue for Salvador Palma's MT5 accounts as a priority for production readiness.
