The AI engineer's work primarily involved stabilizing and enhancing the FIDUS investment platform, focusing on Google Workspace integration and CRM functionality. Initial efforts addressed critical bugs like MongoDB schema validation, Google Drive document segregation, and UI/UX issues. A significant challenge was the persistence and consistency of user/client data, leading to repeated losses of client records (e.g., Alejandro Mariscal) due to a dual storage system (MongoDB and in-memory MOCK_USERS). The AI iterated on fixing authentication, data serialization, and frontend UI discrepancies for Google APIs. Recurring regressions, particularly with Google OAuth and the Connection Monitor, led to user frustration and required multiple rollbacks and re-implementations. The latest focus is on migrating entirely to MongoDB, ensuring Google APIs show real data, and stabilizing core features to meet a production-ready standard after a comprehensive assessment.

The FIDUS financial portal aims to be a comprehensive investment management platform.
**Core Features:**
1.  **Google OAuth Integration**: Admin users authenticate with personal Gmail accounts for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet access.
2.  **Real Google API Integration**: Fetches and displays real Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Meet data for both admin and client portals.
3.  **Gmail Integration**: Supports sending/receiving FIDUS-to-client emails for clients; full Gmail access for admins.
4.  **Calendar Integration**: Enables creation and management of events, including Google Meet links. Client meeting requests should go to the admin portal.
5.  **Drive Integration**: Manages documents with a segregated Google Drive folder per lead/client. Clients can upload documents to their pre-created FIDUS folder.
6.  **Document Signing Functionality**: Document upload, PDF viewing, electronic signature capture, and email notifications (Salvador Palma default signee).
7.  **Admin Login Routing**: Admins redirect correctly post-login, with Google-style connection monitor.
8.  **CRM Integration**: Google functionalities (email, meetings, document requests) integrated within CRM prospect/client details. Pipeline stages (Lead, Negotiation, Won/Lost) with AML/KYC for client conversion.
9.  **Robust Authentication**: Addressing login loops, JWT token handling, and frontend authentication state persistence.
10. **User Admin Functions**: Standard user administration for managing users and ensuring data persistence.
11. **Google Connection Certification**: Procedure to certify Google API connection status (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) via a Google-style monitor showing real-time status.
12. **Client Profile Management**: Clients should be able to edit their profile (photo, email, password) and upload documents.

**Implementation Status:**
*   MongoDB schema validation for prospects/clients fixed.
*   Google Drive folder creation and persistence for prospects implemented.
*   CRM pipeline movement and AML/KYC checks are functional.
*   User administration now connects to a backend endpoint (though persistence issues with  arose).
*   Client-specific document filtering and upload button functionality added (frontend endpoint corrected, backend upload logic added).
*   Client profile update endpoints and UI components added (without full data persistence for users).
*   Admin Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) interfaces now display real data (after fixing frontend data parsing and placeholder UI).
*   Google OAuth redirect URI mismatch resolved with user input.
*   Data persistence issues with MOCK_USERS vs. MongoDB were a recurring problem, with a temporary rollback to  in the latest phase to restore basic functionality.

    -   **Changes**:
        -   Modified  model to use  and added  for MongoDB compatibility (Pydantic models and MongoDB schema alignment).
        -   Updated  fields to use  for MongoDB storage to prevent serialization errors.
        -   Ensured  field is popped from MongoDB responses.
        -   Fixed multiple instances of  to  or  for prospect/client management.
        -   Added  and  endpoints for client profile management.
        -   Implemented  for client document uploads.
        -   Re-aligned Google OAuth redirect URIs and callback endpoints (e.g., ) for consistency.
        -   Implemented, then rolled back, and then re-attempted (partially) the migration of  to MongoDB, involving updates to login, user creation, and user retrieval endpoints to solely use MongoDB, or temporarily reverted to MOCK_USERS for stability.
        -   Fixed MongoDB schema validation errors for user creation ( field type and name).
        -   Modified connection history endpoint () to return real API status instead of mock data.
-   ****: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for Google OAuth credentials (, , ) and MongoDB connection ().

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical recovery and stabilization effort. The user expressed extreme frustration due to repeated functionality regressions, particularly concerning Google Workspace integration and client/user data persistence.

The AI engineer performed a comprehensive system assessment, identifying:
1.  Working authentication but  status for Google APIs.
2.  Multiple duplicate entries for Alejandro Mariscal in client and user lists (10 entries).
3.  Email sending failures due to Google authentication issues.

The immediate actions taken were:
*   **Cleaning up duplicate Alejandro entries**: The latest working Alejandro client () was confirmed to be functional after a previous rollback.
*   **Verifying Google OAuth flow**: The OAuth URL generation was successfully re-tested and confirmed to be properly formatted.

The system is currently in a state where core backend functionalities for client conversion and Google OAuth URL generation are verified post-rollback. However, the user's explicit request to eliminate  data and ensure a fully persistent, production-ready system with all Google APIs, CRM, client login, and a real connection monitor is the overriding goal. The AI has completed backend testing with an 87.5% success rate and frontend verification with a 95% success rate on the current, mostly-rolled-back-to-MOCK-data state.
