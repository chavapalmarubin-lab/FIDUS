The AI engineer has significantly evolved the FIDUS financial portal, initially focused on a document portal and basic CRM. Key developments include robust investment management with fund-specific logic (incubation, interest, redemptions), and a comprehensive user lifecycle system (creation, temporary passwords, forced changes). Persistent Gmail OAuth authentication issues (403, refused to connect) were repeatedly encountered, requiring extensive debugging of scopes, redirect URIs, and OAuth flow mechanisms, eventually resolved by direct redirects and precise Google Cloud Console instructions for the user. Major UX improvements were made to client management, making client rows clickable for investment readiness. Data persistence remains an implicit challenge, as investments are currently in-memory, requiring manual re-creation post-backend restarts. The trajectory concludes with the backend of a new, comprehensive redemption system largely implemented and tested, but frontend integration and full end-to-end validation, along with a critical frontend login bug, are pending.

The FIDUS financial portal aims to be a full-stack platform with an animated logo, dual Client/Admin login, and respective dashboards. Key features include user registration with AML/KYC, client management, password reset, and a comprehensive CRM. The CRM features client onboarding with digital KYC/AML, investor allocation across CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED funds, automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, and role-based portals. Secure document storage with Gmail API integration for sending emails is crucial. Compliance reminders, MT4/MT5 API monitoring, multi-currency support, communication tools, exportable reports, encryption, audit trails, and accounting/n8n integrations are also required. Recent explicit implementations include:
*   Robust Gmail API integration (after fixing multiple auth/redirect issues).
*   Camera capture for AML/KYC in Document Portal and User Registration.
*   Admin CRM enhancement: prospect management with pipeline and conversion to client.
*   FIDUS funds investment logic: 2-month incubation, varying monthly interest rates, specific redemption schedules.
*   Admin-only investment creation (clients view-only).
*   Client investment readiness tracking (AML KYC, Agreement Signed, Date of Deposit) in Client Management.
*   User creation system for Admin to generate new users with temporary passwords and forced password changes on first login.
*   A comprehensive redemption system for both client and admin with fund-specific rules (CORE monthly, BALANCE 3-monthly, DYNAMIC 6-monthly), an approval process, and deposit/redemption activity tracking.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in implementing a **comprehensive redemption system** for the FIDUS Investment Portal. This complex feature aimed to provide fund-specific redemption capabilities (CORE monthly, BALANCE 3-monthly, DYNAMIC 6-monthly), an approval process for admin, and detailed tracking of deposits and redemptions for both clients and admins.

The work encompassed both backend and frontend modifications:
1.  **Backend ():**
    *   **Models:**  and  were introduced to manage redemption requests and track all financial activities.
    *   **In-memory Storage:** New dictionaries were added to  to store redemption requests and activity logs temporarily.
    *   **Business Logic:** Functions like , , and  were implemented to enforce fund-specific redemption rules, calculate eligibility based on investment start dates and fund types, and record all deposit and redemption events.
    *   **API Endpoints:** New API routes were created:  (for clients),  (for admins), and  (to view a client's redemptions).
    *   **Integration:** The  function was updated to log deposit activities, and  was enhanced with  to support the new logic. The backend service was restarted to apply these changes.

2.  **Frontend ():**
    *   **New Components:**  (for client-side requests) and  (for admin approvals) were created.
    *   **Dashboard Integration:**  was modified to include a new Redemptions tab, integrating the  component. Similarly,  was updated to include an Redemptions tab, integrating . This involved adjusting  and  elements in both dashboards. The frontend service was restarted.

The trajectory concludes with the **backend portion of the redemption system being tested** (showing 90% success with 18/20 tests passed by ). However, the **frontend integration, UI validation, and complete end-to-end testing of the redemption workflow remain pending**. Additionally, a critical blank screen login issue, discovered during earlier production readiness frontend testing, also needs to be addressed.

<optional_next_step>
Resolve the blank screen login issue in the frontend to enable full access and then proceed with end-to-end testing of the newly implemented redemption system.
