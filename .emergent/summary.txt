The AI engineer's work spanned several critical areas: initial platform stabilization, implementing major new features, and systematically resolving numerous bugs. Key feature developments include a comprehensive lead-to-client onboarding system, an interactive Investment Simulator with PDF export and multi-currency support, and a complex Google OAuth integration for admin users. The engineer tackled a range of issues, from minor data inconsistencies for specific users to major calculation errors in the investment simulator, and a persistent, multi-faceted authentication loop in the Google integration. The process involved meticulous debugging, code refactoring (e.g., removing duplicate functions), and updating both frontend and backend components. The work faced significant challenges with the Google OAuth flow, requiring multiple iterations of troubleshooting, eventually leading to a direct Google OAuth implementation, but still ending with a core issue where the frontend isn't even sending the callback request to the backend. The journey also included fixing data display, improving lead management, and enhancing UI readability.

The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform for clients and admins, supporting AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation, automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring.

**Implemented/Addressed Features:**
1.  **Lead/Client Onboarding:** A workflow from public signup to client conversion, including lead stages, OFAC AML/KYC checks, and document management. This was enhanced by fixing a Convert button visibility issue for prospects, introducing manual AML/KYC approval, and simplifying the pipeline stages to Lead → Negotiation/Proposal → Won/Lost.
2.  **Investment Simulation:** Allows leads and admins to simulate investment performance across funds (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED) with projected interest and a complete portfolio overview, charts, tables, and a calendar view. Calculations were fixed to correctly use 14-month contracts (2 months incubation + 12 months interest) and display accumulated interest for redemption periods, not monthly.
3.  **PDF Export:** Investment Simulator generates professional PDF reports with FIDUS branding.
4.  **Multi-Currency Support:** Implemented for USD/MXN and USD/EUR, utilizing daily exchange rates, integrated into the Investment Simulator and Client Dashboard.
5.  **Admin Google Integration:** Allows admin users to authenticate with Google for sending emails, scheduling meetings, and sending documents. This evolved from an initial flawed integration to a direct Google OAuth 2.0 implementation, consolidated into a Google Workspace tab with Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Sheets functionalities.
6.  **Deployment Documentation:**  updated with details on secrets, environment variables, and pre-deployment checklists.
7.  **Data Consistency & Display:** Fixed issues where Salvador Palma's investments showed /bin/bash or were missing, MT5 accounts were empty, and fund portfolio totals were incorrect, ensuring all client and investment data displays accurately across the frontend.
8.  **Client Document Management:** Added functionality for admins to upload documents for clients directly from the client details view.
9.  **UI Readability:** Resolved a bug where active tab names became unreadable due to CSS contrast issues across the application.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep in debugging a critical, persistent issue with the Google OAuth integration. Despite several iterative fixes—including consolidating Google functionality into a single  tab, correcting hardcoded URLs in the backend's , adding exceptions for Google OAuth endpoints in the JWT middleware in , implementing a direct Google OAuth 2.0 flow using the user-provided Client ID and Client Secret, and ensuring lazy initialization of the Google service—the Google sign-in process is still failing after the user grants consent.

The user reports no functionality and the AI's latest debug (Chat 580) revealed that while the backend successfully generates the Google OAuth authorization URL (), the frontend's  component is **never making the POST request** to the backend's  endpoint. Backend logs confirm no hits for the callback endpoint, indicating a frontend-side issue preventing the authorization code from being sent. The immediate focus is to pinpoint why this POST request is not being initiated in the  component, potentially due to an incorrect , a JavaScript error in the  request, or an issue with the authorization code extraction or its subsequent use.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate  to ensure  is correctly configured and the POST request to the backend callback is initiated without JavaScript errors.
