The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical MT5 data synchronization issues and refining fund profitability calculations for the FIDUS investment platform. Initially, the project involved addressing architectural inconsistencies related to Kubernetes vs. Render.com deployment, leading to a thorough audit and correction of environment variables and hardcoded URLs in . A major effort was dedicated to diagnosing and temporarily resolving a 21.88 MT5 data discrepancy for account 886528, which was ultimately identified as the MetaTrader 5 terminal not running on the Windows VPS. This led to an emergency manual balance update. Simultaneously, the engineer refined fund profitability calculations by correctly incorporating the separation account balance and developing new API endpoints. Google OAuth integration for client  was diagnosed as requiring user authorization. Autonomous monitoring capabilities were also established.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for client onboarding, MT5 data, and cash flow, focusing on precise date calculations and consolidated dashboards. Key features include Trading Analytics and a Money Managers Profile System with 1:1 MT5 account mapping. The user requested fixes for client portal redemptions, a broken client calendar, profile updates, and a robust Google Workspace OAuth 2.0 integration for  (later clarified for ). A critical issue involved a 21.88 MT5 data discrepancy for account 886528, requiring investigation and resolution. Most recently, the mission shifted to exclusively perfect MT5 data flow accuracy and fund profitability, including the separation account balance in calculations, aiming for a total fund asset of ,909.31 and a net position of -0,085.69.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, ), MongoDB Atlas.
-   **Frontend**: React.js (Yarn, Tailwind CSS).
-   **MT5 Integration**: MetaTrader5 Python package, FastAPI bridge, external Windows VPS.
-   **Deployment**: Render.com, Supervisor.
-   **Google Integration**: OAuth 2.0, Google API Python Client.
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Central API entry point. Heavily modified for Google OAuth, MT5 integration, and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected hardcoded  URLs to  (frontend) and  (backend). Fixed  flag to . Added new MT5 health check and auto-sync endpoints, then fixed their  prefixes. Integrated  startup/shutdown. Corrected database truth value testing ( to ). Added  endpoint to provide enhanced fund profitability calculations.
-   ****: Handles robust OAuth 2.0 implementation.
    -   **Importance**: Manages Google API connections and token lifecycle.
    -   **Changes**: No direct code changes, but its functionality was debugged; the issue was identified as missing user authorization rather than code flaws.
-   ** (NEW)**: Automated MT5 data synchronization service.
    -   **Importance**: Designed to periodically fetch and update MT5 account data, resolving discrepancies.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented retry logic for fetching MT5 data. Fixed database queries to use  field instead of . Corrected database truth value testing. Added enhanced error logging using .
-   ** (NEW)**: Script for immediate manual balance correction.
    -   **Importance**: Used as a temporary measure to resolve the 21.88 discrepancy for account 886528.
    -   **Changes**: A one-off script to directly update MongoDB for a specific MT5 account's balance and equity.
-   ****: Client for communicating with the external MT5 bridge service.
    -   **Importance**: Facilitates interaction between the FastAPI backend and the MT5 terminal on a Windows VPS.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced error logging. Identified the MT5 bridge endpoints and their response.
-   ** (NEW)**: A new file for monitoring MT5 sync status.
    -   **Importance**: Part of implementing robust error handling and resilience.
    -   **Changes**: Provides an endpoint for checking MT5 sync health.
-   ****: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Configures the frontend's connection to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to  and added .

<pending_tasks>
-   **MT5 Terminal Startup**: The MetaTrader 5 terminal needs to be manually started on the Windows VPS (217.197.163.11) by the user.
-   **Google OAuth Authorization**: The user needs to visit the provided OAuth URL and authorize  for Google Workspace integration.
-   **Frontend Deployment on Render**: The user needs to manually create and configure the frontend service on Render.com with the specified settings and environment variables.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed and deployed the fix for the **Fund Profitability Calculations**. This involved:
1.  **Correcting fund calculation logic**: The AI identified that the INTEREST_SEPARATION account (886528) and MT5 trading equity were not correctly included in the overall fund asset calculation, and  was often .
2.  **Creating a new calculation endpoint**: A new API endpoint  was added to .
3.  **Implementing the logic**: This new endpoint correctly aggregates MT5 trading equity (17,654.63) and separation interest (,405.53) to derive Total Fund Assets (21,060.16) and a Net Fund Profitability of +,908.75.
4.  **Local Testing**: The endpoint was thoroughly tested locally and confirmed to return the correct, positive profitability and breakdown of assets.
5.  **Deployment**: The changes were committed, and a deployment to production was triggered.

Simultaneously, the AI was continuously monitoring the MT5 data synchronization and resilience, confirming that while the emergency 21.88 discrepancy fix for account 886528 was successfully applied to the database, the MT5 bridge service remained unable to connect to a live MT5 terminal, preventing automated sync.
