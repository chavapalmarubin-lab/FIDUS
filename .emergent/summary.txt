The trajectory details a multi-phase development and debugging effort on the FIDUS platform. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the MT5 integration, which involved setting up a FastAPI bridge on a Windows VPS, resolving numerous environment issues (NumPy, firewalls), and fixing backend endpoint registration and module-level name collisions. A persistent blocker identified was Kubernetes ingress routing.

Subsequently, a significant portion of the work revolved around fixing the Google OAuth integration, plagued by URL mismatches, token storage issues, and frontend-backend API response format inconsistencies. This included attempts to refactor to an Emergent Auth system, which was later reverted when the existing OAuth was found to be functional after core configuration and response handling fixes.

The project then transitioned to a new feature: enabling multiple MT5 account mappings per investment with strict investor password warnings. An initial pool approach for MT5 accounts was implemented, then refactored to a just-in-time allocation during investment creation. The current task is blocked by a React compilation error in , occurring after the latest refactoring.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for internal admin users, requiring secure user management (JWT, Google OAuth), a production-grade MongoDB Atlas database, and real-time financial data from MetaTrader5 (MT5). It enforces data integrity via robust validation. So far, MongoDB Atlas and a FastAPI bridge for MT5 on a Windows VPS are integrated.

Recent enhancements focus on MT5:
1.  **Multiple MT5 Account Mapping**: Support unlimited MT5 accounts per investment product, ensuring total allocations match the investment amount.
2.  **MT5 Account Exclusivity**: Prevent reusing MT5 accounts across different clients.
3.  **Investor Password Management**: Crucially, the system must *only* accept MT5 Investor Passwords (read-only), *never* Trading Passwords. Prominent visual warnings are mandatory across all MT5-related interfaces.
4.  **MT5 Account Deallocation**: Implement an admin-approved workflow with mandatory notes and audit trails.
5.  **Admin-Only MT5 Management**: Restrict creation, editing, and deallocation to admins, requiring mandatory notes for all changes.
6.  **Broker Account Structure**: Support OMNIBUS sub-accounts and future multi-broker integration.
7.  **Google OAuth Integration**: Ensure secure login via JWT and OAuth 2.0 with Google Workspace for CRM functions (Gmail, Calendar, Drive).

<current_work>
The immediate work involved refactoring the MT5 account management system from a pre-populated pool approach to a just-in-time allocation during investment creation.

The previous AI engineer:
1.  **Updated Database Models**: Adjusted MT5 account models to support just-in-time creation. ( was created).
2.  **Updated API Endpoints**: Modified  to remove pool creation endpoints and add validation/allocation endpoints tied to investment creation. The router prefix in  was corrected from  to .
3.  **Updated MT5 Management Component**: Refactored  to be a view-only dashboard, removing Add MT5 Account functionality and updating table display logic.
4.  **Created Investment Creation Form**: Started developing  to handle just-in-time MT5 account entry within the investment creation flow.
5.  **Tested Backend**: Successfully tested the refactored backend MT5 pool endpoints, confirming functionality for health checks, statistics, available/allocated accounts, exclusivity checks, and mapping validation.

Currently, there is a **React compilation error** in  at line 669, stating Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. This is blocking access to the application.
