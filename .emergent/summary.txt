The AI engineer systematically addressed complex feature additions and critical bug fixes. Initially, MT5 integration was implemented, including a mock service, database schema extensions, backend API endpoints, and frontend components for both admin and client views. This was followed by a document sharing system, unifying client and admin document management with categorization and MongoDB persistence. A comprehensive UX, Security, and Performance audit was then conducted, leading to critical security (headers, API protection, MFA) and UX (page titles, headings, loading states, toast, breadcrumbs) enhancements, alongside performance optimizations (code splitting, caching utilities). The work then pivoted to a persistent login failure bug, which was challenging to diagnose due to intermittent behavior. The root cause was identified as an overly restrictive authentication middleware, temporarily disabled to restore dashboard functionality. The current state is a functional application with enhanced features, but the core authentication middleware needs a proper re-implementation to support the new security features without blocking legitimate access.

The FIDUS financial portal is a full-stack platform for investment management, featuring an animated logo, dual Client/Admin login, and role-based dashboards. Key functionalities include user registration with AML/KYC, client management, password reset, and a CRM for investor allocation across CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, and UNLIMITED funds. The system requires automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards, secure document storage with Gmail API, compliance, MT4/MT5 API monitoring, multi-currency support, communication tools, exportable reports, encryption, audit trails, and accounting/n8n integrations. Recent implementations focused on refining AML/KYC, admin CRM with prospect management, detailed fund investment logic, client investment readiness, user creation with temporary passwords, comprehensive redemption systems, payment confirmation, investment calendars, fund portfolio and cash flow management, transitioning to MongoDB, client registration auto-add to CRM leads, and CRM document capabilities.

<pending_tasks>
- Re-implement or properly integrate the authentication middleware to work with the frontend's authentication mechanism without blocking legitimate API calls. This is critical as the middleware was temporarily disabled.
- Implement API rate limiting and request signing for sensitive operations, as planned in the security roadmap.
- Complete the integration of the  component with real data and visualizations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively debugging a critical issue where the admin dashboard failed to load data, presenting blank sections despite successful login. This bug emerged after implementing extensive security and UX enhancements in Phase 1 and 2, which included adding a robust authentication middleware in . The investigation revealed that this newly introduced middleware was inadvertently blocking all authenticated admin API calls, returning 401 Unauthorized errors, because it was not correctly interpreting the frontend's existing authentication mechanism (which relies on  for user data rather than session cookies or explicit authorization headers for every request).

To resolve this critical blocking issue and restore dashboard functionality, the AI engineer made the immediate decision to **temporarily disable the problematic authentication middleware** in . This temporary fix allowed the backend API endpoints to return data successfully, confirming the middleware as the root cause of the data loading failure. The current state is that the backend API endpoints are functional, and the dashboard should now be able to retrieve data, but the security middleware intended for enhanced protection is currently inactive.
