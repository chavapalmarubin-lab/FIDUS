The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a challenging, iterative process to stabilize the FIDUS MT5 Bridge and its ecosystem. Initially, the focus was on deploying a multi-account MT5 Bridge and auto-healing, which quickly hit roadblocks with Windows VPS SSH/PowerShell deployments and a critical multi-account balance issue due to MT5 Terminal session isolation. Despite multiple attempts to deploy fixes and continuous requests from the AI for manual user intervention, the user (Chava) firmly pushed for automated, end-to-end verification.

The AI then tackled several issues: fixing the multi-account logic within the MT5 Bridge, addressing discrepancies in broker rebates calculation (due to stale MongoDB data and incorrect date ranges), resolving frontend CORS errors preventing real-time bridge status display, and debugging persistent GitHub push failures. The AI identified and fixed a YAML syntax error in a deployment workflow, created new sync services for MT5 deals, and refined frontend components. The most recent efforts involved fixing backend configuration discrepancies (e.g., GitHub repository URL in health checks) and refining the MT5 watchdog logic. A key recurring challenge was the AI's inability to reliably push code to GitHub or perform remote deployments, often resorting to providing manual instructions to the user.

The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system requiring real-time data and robust automation.

1.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Monitors the MT5 Bridge API, triggers auto-healing (restarts Bridge/MT5 terminals) via GitHub Actions, and sends alerts. Requires VPS-level control and auto-recovery.
    *   **Implementation Done**: Watchdog for 0% sync rate, GitHub Actions for restarts/diagnostics, initial Task Scheduler fixes, and a backend fix for zero balances. SSH setup on VPS is complete. A zero-touch auto-healing workflow () has been created, checking health every 15 minutes and auto-restarting if down. The watchdog was later updated to exclude SEPARATION accounts from zero balance warnings.
2.  **Infrastructure Migration**: All references to the old VPS infrastructure must be removed. (No explicit work on this in the trajectory).
3.  **Prospects Portal**: Development of a  section for lead capture, including an investment simulator. (No explicit work on this in the trajectory).
4.  **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: Rebuild to enable admin users to connect Gmail, Calendar, Drive for email, scheduling, event/file management, with consistent OAuth handling.
    *   **Implementation Done**: Core OAuth flow, token acquisition, storage, frontend connection status, Gmail message bodies, Calendar events, Drive files, and disconnect functionality are operational.  errors and frontend routing were fixed. Gmail  modified.
5.  **Quick Actions UI for System Management**: Implement a new Quick Actions tab in the frontend's Tech Documentation section for direct control and monitoring of the MT5 Bridge without manual VPS access.
    *   **Implementation Done**:  component created,  modified to integrate this component and a Full Documentation tab (rendering ). A Sync Trade History button was later requested and moved to the Broker Rebates tab.
6.  **Multi-Account Balance Synchronization**: Restore proper fetching and display of balances for all 7 MT5 accounts (not just the master), ensuring historical trade data is populated. This was working previously and needs to be re-established.
    *   **Implementation State**: Identified as a critical regression due to MT5 Terminal session isolation (Python service in Session 0, Terminal in Session 1) and lack of multi-account login. A new MT5 Bridge v4.0 with multi-account logic was created and successfully deployed (likely manually by the user or an auto-commit).
7.  **Broker Rebates Calculation Fix**: Rectify inconsistencies in broker rebates display and calculation.
    *   **Implementation Done**: A new  was created to fetch trade history from the MT5 Bridge and populate MongoDB. Broker Rebates and Cash Flow pages were adjusted to consistently use ALL-TIME cumulative rebates.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main API. Modified to include a new endpoint for MT5 deals sync () and updated the  block to use the  environment variable for local execution, aligning with the Render deployment. Also fixed the Cash Flow endpoint to correctly pass date parameters for rebates calculation.
-   ****: **NEW**. This service was created to fetch historical trade data from the MT5 Bridge and store it in the  MongoDB collection, crucial for accurate rebates calculation. Fixed an  usage issue.
-   ****: Monitors MT5 Bridge health. Modified to update GitHub repository URL from  to  to fix API 404 errors. Enhanced  to exclude 'SEPARATION' fund type accounts from triggering warnings as they are expected to have zero balances.
-   ****: React component for Quick Actions. Modified to fix a CORS error by routing MT5 Bridge health checks through the backend proxy () instead of directly to the VPS IP. Also updated to use  for authentication and included robust token checking, although the Sync Trade History button functionality was later moved.
-   ****: React component for Broker Rebates. Modified to default to All-Time rebates instead of Last 30 Days to match the user's wallet. A Sync Trade History button was added to this component, including logic for fetching  for authentication and triggering the backend deals sync endpoint.
-   ****: React component. Modified to potentially integrate new Quick Actions features. An issue was identified with importing  which might be broken, leading to frontend display errors.
-   ****: **NEW**. This script represents the fixed MT5 Bridge (v4.0) designed to properly log into all 7 MT5 accounts, fetch their real balances, and cache the data. It addresses the session isolation problem and the original /bin/bash.00 balance issue for non-master accounts.
-   ****: **NEW**. A PowerShell script created to configure a Windows Scheduled Task on the VPS to run the MT5 Bridge service automatically in the interactive user session, ensuring it survives reboots and runs in the background.
-   ****: **NEW**. GitHub Actions workflow created to deploy  to the VPS.
-   ****: **NEW/MODIFIED**. This GitHub Actions workflow was created to deploy both the fixed MT5 Bridge script and set up the Windows Task Scheduler on the VPS. It was extensively debugged for YAML syntax errors related to PowerShell commands.
-   ****: **NEW**. A PowerShell script created for manual or remote deployment to the VPS, intended to deploy the fixed MT5 Bridge.
-   ****: **NEW**. Documents the fix for the multi-account balance issue.
-   ****: **NEW**. Provides instructions for manual deployment of the MT5 fix on the VPS.
-   ****: **NEW**. Details the data flow and deployment status for end-to-end verification.
-   ****: **NEW**. Comprehensive guide for the full deployment process.
-   ** / **: **NEW**. Markdown files created to summarize outstanding deployment tasks and locally committed changes, intended for user's Save to GitHub action.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Deploy all committed changes (backend and frontend) to GitHub and Render.
-   Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow Deploy MT5 Bridge with Task Scheduler Setup (or manually deploy the task scheduler).
-   Verify the Sync Trade History button on the Broker Rebates tab works correctly with authentication.
-   Verify frontend components (System Health tab, Technical Documentation) are visually correct and error-free after deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was focused on debugging and fixing several backend and frontend issues reported by the user.

1.  **Backend Port Configuration**: The Render backend logs showed No open ports detected and Uvicorn running on 8000. The AI investigated and clarified that the Emergent environment's supervisor uses port 8001, but added an  block to  to use the  environment variable for local consistency.
2.  **GitHub Repository URL in Health Check**: The backend's health monitor was attempting to access  which resulted in a 404. The AI corrected this URL in  to .
3.  **MT5 Watchdog Zero Balance Warning**: The watchdog was reporting a warning for 1/7 accounts showing /bin/bash balance. The AI identified that account 886528 (SEPARATION-Reserve) correctly has a /bin/bash balance. The  was updated to explicitly exclude 'SEPARATION' accounts from this warning.

All these backend fixes were committed locally. The AI successfully restarted the backend using backend: stopped
backend: started. The very last action was to begin verifying these latest backend fixes by checking the backend health.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the backend health check to confirm all recently applied fixes are operational.
