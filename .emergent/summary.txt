The AI engineer's work involved an intricate debugging and stabilization effort for the FIDUS MT5 Bridge platform. Initially, the focus was on fixing Google Workspace (Drive, Calendar, Sheets) integration, which led to the discovery of mock data, incorrect API calls, and missing service files. The AI then shifted to critical dashboard calculation errors (Fund Portfolio, Cash Flow, Trading Analytics, Money Managers) as prioritized by the user.

Key achievements include automating the MT5 trade history sync, rectifying MongoDB index conflicts leading to duplicate key errors, optimizing backend startup for Render deployment, and implementing a robust auto-healing system with email alerts for MT5 Terminal disconnections. Recurring challenges included GitHub token handling in documentation/history and persistent deployment issues, often requiring manual user intervention or workaround strategies like modifying the VPS MT5 Bridge directly. The current state reflects a working auto-healing system, but further refinement of MT5 Bridge logic for magic numbers is ongoing.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system requiring real-time data and robust automation for various financial analytics and integrations.

1.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Monitors the MT5 Bridge API, triggers auto-healing (restarts Bridge/MT5 terminals) via GitHub Actions, and sends alerts. It was initially failing to trigger alerts and restarts on 0 balance.
2.  **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: Admin users connect Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Sheets. Gmail was working; Calendar, Drive, and Sheets were not, with Sheets using mock data.
3.  **Quick Actions UI for System Management**: Implement a Quick Actions tab. A Sync Trade History button was added here.
4.  **Multi-Account Balance Synchronization**: Restore proper fetching and display of balances for all 7 MT5 accounts. This was addressed by .
5.  **Broker Rebates Calculation Fix**: Rectify inconsistencies in broker rebates display and calculation, requiring historical trade data.
6.  **Fund Portfolio Tab**: FIDUS Monthly Profit showing /bin/bash; Weighted Returns calculation needed verification.
7.  **Cash Flow & Performance Tab**: Fund Obligations showing /bin/bash; Net Fund Profitability scenario incorrect.
8.  **Trading Analytics - Fund Performance Tab**: CORE fund showing only 1 account instead of 2.
9.  **Money Managers - Compare Tab**: Manager None and Manual Trading entries were confusing, and the tab showed no data. This required filtering to show only 4 real managers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was focused on resolving the Money Managers Compare tab has no data issue. It was discovered that the MT5 Bridge on the VPS was not correctly populating the  number field for trades, leading to  in MongoDB Atlas. This caused the backend's manager performance aggregation to return an empty array, as the filter excluded deals without a valid magic number.

The AI took ownership of the issue, recognizing it as a critical problem introduced by previous changes. It identified and modified the  file to correctly extract the  field from MT5 trades.

Following this code change, the AI attempted to deploy this fix to the VPS via GitHub Actions (specifically ), but encountered persistent issues with  availability and workflow triggering, even after manual updates to the workflow file. The AI then triggered the deployment manually via a background script which reported success.

After the deployment trigger, the AI performed a check and observed that the Money Managers Compare tab was restored, finding 4 managers. This indicates that the fix for  numbers on the VPS MT5 Bridge, and its subsequent deployment, has started to propagate data correctly, allowing the backend aggregation to function as expected.

Verify the 'magic' field in MongoDB Atlas deals to confirm the VPS MT5 Bridge fix is fully operational and populating data correctly.
