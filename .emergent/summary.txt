The previous AI engineerâ€™s work focused on stabilizing the FIDUS platform, primarily addressing critical MT5 Bridge auto-healing and data synchronization issues, alongside Google Workspace integration. The trajectory illustrates a highly iterative process, moving from initial fixes (async errors, Google OAuth routing, Gmail content fetching) to more complex infrastructure challenges.

Key challenges revolved around MT5 Bridge instability: consistent  balances,  errors due to session conflicts, Unicode logging crashes, and incorrect Task Scheduler configurations on a Windows VPS. The AI initially attempted GitHub Actions for remote fixes, but this revealed a fundamental disconnect with the Windows VPS (RDP only, no SSH). A significant pivot involved a manual SSH setup by the user, enabling proper GitHub Actions automation.

Despite this, the AI struggled with robust automated deployment and consistently provided manual workarounds, leading to user frustration. The root cause of  balances was identified as the MT5 Bridge forcing account switches for each query. This was partially addressed by a backend fix to ignore temporary zeros, but the user pushed for a complete Bridge code overhaul for single-connection multi-account querying. The final identified problem involves incorrect rebate calculations due to missing historical trade data, caused by an incomplete MT5 Bridge deployment lacking the necessary trade history endpoint. The AI is now working on a complete Bridge script.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an MT5 investment management system designed for real-time account data and robust automation.
1.  **MT5 Auto-Healing System**: Monitors MT5 Bridge API for failures (e.g., /bin/bash balances or bridge unavailability), triggers auto-healing via GitHub Actions (restarting Bridge and MT5 terminals), and sends email alerts. Requires robust VPS-level control and automatic recovery without manual intervention.
    *   **Implementation Done**: Watchdog for 0% sync rate detection, GitHub Actions workflows for full restarts and diagnostics, initial attempts to fix Task Scheduler, and a backend fix to gracefully handle zero balances during MT5 account switching. SSH setup on VPS is complete, enabling automated deployments. A zero-touch auto-healing workflow () has been created.
2.  **Infrastructure Migration**: All references to the old VPS infrastructure must be removed. (No explicit work on this in the trajectory).
3.  **Prospects Portal**: Development of a  section for lead capture, including an investment simulator with a dark, professional theme. (No explicit work on this in the trajectory).
4.  **Google Workspace OAuth Integration (Admin Focus)**: A complete rebuild to enable admin users (specifically ) to connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive for email, meeting scheduling, event management, and file operations. This includes explicit account selection,  pre-selection, consistent callback URIs, centralized credential management, and robust OAuth state handling.
    *   **Implementation Done**: Core OAuth flow, token acquisition, storage, frontend connection status display, Gmail message bodies, Calendar events, Drive files, and disconnect functionality are operational.  errors and frontend routing for Google OAuth were fixed. Gmail  modified to . Frontend API call paths for Calendar and Drive corrected.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was deeply engaged in resolving critical MT5 Bridge issues that impacted data integrity and system stability.
Initially, the dashboard was showing /bin/bash balances despite the Bridge being healthy. This was traced to the MT5 Terminal aggressively switching accounts when the Bridge queried them individually. An intermediate backend fix was applied in  (lines 213-215) to prevent accepting /bin/bash balances during mid-switch. However, the user clarified the root problem: the Bridge itself was repeatedly calling  for each account, rather than using a single, persistent connection with a manager account to query all data programmatically.

The AI then created and deployed a revised Bridge script, , and a corresponding GitHub Actions workflow (). This successfully resolved the /bin/bash balance issue.

However, a new problem immediately arose: broker rebates were incorrect, and historical trade data was missing. Investigation revealed that the  MongoDB collection was empty due to  logs, and, crucially, the *recently deployed fixed Bridge script was incomplete*. It was missing vital endpoints like , and the  endpoint required by the  to fetch historical trades.

The AI is now in the process of creating a *complete* MT5 Bridge script, , which will include all necessary endpoints and the proper single-connection multi-account querying implementation to fully address these issues.
