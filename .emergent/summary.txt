The previous AI engineer's work centered on enhancing the FIDUS investment management platform, primarily focusing on a Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System. Initial efforts involved building backend and frontend components, extensive debugging of fund performance calculations, and addressing database inconsistencies. A significant phase was dedicated to resolving a wide array of bug reports and feature requests. This included implementing a comprehensive stress test plan, fixing rate limiting and MT5 multi-broker authentication issues, ensuring the MT5 tab displayed real historical data, creating a centralized Application Documents tab, streamlining the client dashboard, correcting fund balance displays for individual funds, and overhahauling the cash flow management to align with proper fund accounting principles, including lot-based rebates. The engineer also established an ongoing documentation protocol. The current task involves integrating MT5 account mapping directly into the Create Investment workflow, addressing a critical gap in client onboarding.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS financial portal is an investment management platform for client/admin roles, supporting AML/KYC, CRM, fund allocation (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED), automated capital flows, real-time AUM/NAV/performance, and MT4/MT5 API monitoring.

Key requirements and implemented features include:
1.  **Fund Performance vs MT5 Reality Management System:** Admin dashboard to compare client fund commitments against MT5 returns, using MT5 data as source of truth (deposit amount, profit, withdrawal, current balance), simple interest for commitments, and displaying only funds with client investments. No guaranteed funds.
2.  **Client Dashboard:** Displays correct individual fund balances (e.g., BALANCE .4M, CORE /bin/bash.00), not generic labels. Removed redundant Fund Commitments tab.
3.  **Application-Wide Branding:** Updated to a new FIDUS logo with proper sizing across all pages.
4.  **Scalability:** The system must handle scaling from 1 to 100 MT5 accounts within a month, necessitating robust stress testing and performance optimizations.
5.  **Robust Authentication:** JWT-based system, with fixes for admin endpoints to ensure proper access control.
6.  **Comprehensive Documentation for CTO:** A detailed deployment guide, system health monitors, and performance dashboards for production hosting.
7.  **Admin Application Documents Tab:** Centralized access to all system documentation.
8.  **Cash Flow Management:** Must follow proper fund accounting principles (MT5 trading profits + broker rebates as assets; client interest obligations + redemptions as liabilities). Includes lot-based rebate entry.
9.  **CRM Dashboard:** Trading Monitor shows real client MT5 data (not mock data). MetaQuotes Data tab displays mapped MT5 accounts.
10. **MT5 Account Mapping in Investment Creation:** Ability to input MT5 login credentials during client investment creation, accounting for potential fee differences.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on integrating MT5 account mapping directly into the Create Investment workflow within the  component. The user explicitly requested this functionality, highlighting that once a lead becomes a client, their MT5 login credentials should be captured during the investment creation process. This is crucial for linking client investments to their actual MT5 trading accounts and accounting for potential differences in initial balances due to banking or crypto fees.

The engineer successfully:
1.  Identified that the  component lacked the necessary fields for MT5 account mapping.
2.  Updated the component's state to include new fields: , , , , and .
3.  Located the investment creation modal within .
4.  Added a new MT5 Account Mapping section to this modal, positioned after the Payment Confirmation Required section, complete with input fields for the newly added MT5-related data.

The very last action taken by the AI engineer was to begin updating the backend () to handle the persistence of these new MT5 account details when an investment is created. This ensures the data captured in the frontend form is correctly processed and stored.
