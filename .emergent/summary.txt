The trajectory details an iterative, often challenging, interaction where the AI engineer refined complex financial calculations and began a new system documentation project. Initially, the AI made incorrect assumptions about MT5 terminal status and fundamental accounting (treating total equity as profit). Through rigorous, detailed feedback from the user (Chava/Claude), the AI corrected its understanding, fixed critical bugs related to P&L, reserve accounting, and timeline-based performance. A key learning was the AI explicitly stating its RDP limitations, leading to a clear division of labor with the user. The financial system is now accurately calculating and reporting a highly profitable fund. Subsequently, a new project for an Interactive Technical Documentation Project was initiated, with GitHub integration, which the AI is currently starting on Phase 1.

The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for client onboarding, MT5 data, and cash flow, focusing on precise date calculations and consolidated dashboards. Initial tasks included fixing client portal redemptions, a broken client calendar, profile updates, and robust Google Workspace OAuth 2.0 integration. A critical issue was resolving a 21.88 MT5 data discrepancy for account 886528. The core mission evolved to perfect MT5 data flow accuracy and fund profitability, ensuring separation account balance (886528) was correctly included as a reserve, and profit/loss calculations accurately reflected current equity minus initial deposits over the 14-month contract duration. The most recent and ongoing product requirement is to create an Interactive Technical Command Center from the existing App Documentation tab, featuring live system architecture visualization, credentials management, API documentation, real-time health monitoring, and quick actions, with GitHub serving as the central source of truth.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, ), MongoDB Atlas.
- **Frontend**: React.js (Yarn, Tailwind CSS), React Flow.
- **MT5 Integration**: MetaTrader5 Python package, FastAPI bridge, Windows VPS.
- **Deployment**: Render.com, Supervisor, Kubernetes.
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub Actions.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Acts as the central API gateway for the FIDUS platform.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly modified to correct fund profitability calculations. Key updates included:
        -   Switching from  to  for trading accounts, ensuring real-time value.
        -   Special handling for account  (Interest Separation Account) to use its  field (which was explicitly deemed correct for non-trading accounts after an emergency update).
        -   Implementing actual P&L calculation as .
        -   Incorporating contract timeline details (e.g., 11 active days out of 426) to provide a time-based performance assessment.
        -   Treating account  as an  reserve fund, reducing the still to generate interest obligations.
        -   Corrected logic in  and  to reflect these financial models.
        -   Placeholder for new  endpoints related to the Interactive Technical Documentation Project.
-   ****: Automated service for MT5 data synchronization.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures periodic fetching and updating of MT5 account data in MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: Identified that account  was not included in its configuration, preventing its  field from being updated automatically.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Importance**: This new file will store a hardcoded inventory of all system components. It's the foundational data structure for the Interactive Technical Documentation Project.
    -   **Changes**: Created this file as the first step of Phase 1.
-   ** (NEW - planned)**:
    -   **Importance**: This new module is planned to contain functions for performing basic health checks on various system components.
    -   **Changes**: Planned for creation as part of Phase 1.
-   ** (NEW - planned)**:
    -   **Importance**: This new React component will serve as the main view for the Interactive Technical Documentation Project, replacing or enhancing the current static documentation.
    -   **Changes**: Planned for creation as part of Phase 1.
-   ** (NEW - planned)**:
    -   **Importance**: This new React component will be used to display individual system components within the  view, showing their status and basic information.
    -   **Changes**: Planned for creation as part of Phase 1.

<pending_tasks>
-   **MT5 Terminal Configuration**: Ensure account 886528 is added to the MT5 bridge service script on the VPS to enable automatic equity syncing.
-   **Google OAuth Authorization**: User needs to visit the provided OAuth URL and authorize .
-   **Frontend Deployment on Render**: User needs to manually create and configure the frontend service on Render.com.
-   **Interactive Technical Documentation Project - Phase 1**:
    -   Implement .
    -   Add new API endpoints to : , , .
    -   Create new React components:  and .

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the highly iterative and complex task of refining the **Fund Profitability Calculations** and verifying the **MT5 Data Flow**. This involved fixing multiple accounting errors (e.g., distinguishing principal from P&L, using correct / fields, incorporating contract timelines, and treating the interest separation account as a reserve). The backend () was updated to correctly calculate a  of -8,802.72 (a deficit) initially, and then, after incorporating the full contract timeline and the nature of the interest separation account as a reserve, a positive  of +44,904.65 (projected surplus) was accurately determined, with the fund performing 5.9x ahead of target. The API endpoint  and  now return these correct, timeline-based performance figures. MT5 data flow was verified, confirming trading accounts sync, but noting  was not in the sync script.

With the financial calculations now verified as accurate and the system declared Production Ready, the AI has transitioned to a new, major project: the **Interactive Technical Documentation Project**. This project aims to transform the static App Documentation into a dynamic command center. The AI is currently at the very beginning of **Phase 1: Foundation & Data Structure**. The first action for this phase, creating the  file to hold the component inventory, has been successfully completed. The next immediate step is to create the associated health check module.
