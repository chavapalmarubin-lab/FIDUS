<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a **Next-Generation Trading Analytics Dashboard** for the FIDUS application. This dashboard must replace the current, basic Trading Analytics view and be a world-class, institutional-grade analytics tool.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
-   **Aesthetic:** Dark luxury fintech (deep navy/charcoal, gold/cyan accents).
-   **Typography:** DM Mono for data, Sora/Plus Jakarta Sans for headings.
-   **Layout:** Dense, information-rich grid with tabs and sparklines.
-   **Data Source:** Use **real, live data** from the existing MongoDB database and backend APIs (e.g., ).
-   **Structure:**
    1.  **Top Header Bar:** Time-period selector, Refresh/Export buttons, live clock.
    2.  **Summary KPI Strip:** Key aggregate metrics (Total AUM, Active Strategies, etc.).
    3.  **Main Tabs:**
        -   **Portfolio Overview:** Radar, bar, pie, and scatter charts for fund-level analysis.
        -   **Manager Rankings:** Detailed leaderboard table, head-to-head comparison, and risk alerts.
        -   **Deep Dive:** A detailed profile for a selected strategy, showing extensive stats and historical performance charts (defaults to TradingHub Gold).
        -   **AI Strategy Advisor:** An LLM-powered chat interface for data analysis (DEFERRED to a future phase).
-   **Technical Stack:** React, Recharts, Tailwind CSS, lucide-react. The entire dashboard should be built within a single new component.
-   **Phasing:** The current request is to build **Phase 1 (Core Structure & Design)** and **Phase 2 (All Dashboard Components except AI Advisor)**.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI app with a MongoDB Atlas database. In this session, the agent successfully implemented a new LIVE DEMO tab, which involved creating a new frontend component () and a corresponding backend endpoint (). This work also led to the resolution of a critical data sync issue by correctly configuring new MT5 accounts in the  MongoDB collection, allowing the existing VPS bridge script to sync their data. The agent also added comprehensive documentation to  on how to add new MT5 accounts.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was processing the user's request to build the new Next-Generation Trading Analytics Dashboard. It has already clarified the scope with the user: to build Phases 1 and 2, replace the existing tab, use live data, and defer the AI component. The agent is now ready to begin implementation.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent after completing both Phase 1 and Phase 2.
-   **User Testing Done:** N/A

    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This is a known issue carried over from a previous session.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** Investigate the  logic in the MT5 sync service for the Lucrum bridge to handle potential race conditions or non-unique keys that might be causing failures during data synchronization.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Ensures complete and accurate deal history for all Lucrum accounts without data loss or sync interruptions.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Build Next-Gen Trading Analytics Dashboard - Phase 1 & 2:** This is the immediate and highest-priority task.
        -   **Phase 1:** Implement the core component structure and the dark luxury design system (colors, fonts, base layout).
        -   **Phase 2:** Build all specified dashboard components (KPI strip, Portfolio Overview, Manager Rankings, Deep Dive) and wire them to live backend data.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **(P1) Build Next-Gen Trading Analytics Dashboard - Phase 3:** Implement the AI Strategy Advisor tab with LLM integration.
    -   **(P2)** Verify pagination on the TRACK-RECORD Orders tab.
    -   **(P2)** Refactor the large  component into smaller sub-components.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **LIVE DEMO Feature:**
    -   Created a new LIVE DEMO tab with its own component () and backend endpoint ().
    -   Successfully onboarded and configured 5 new live demo MT5 accounts, which are now syncing correctly from the VPS.
    -   Implemented P&L and ROI tracking based on user-defined initial allocations.
-   **System Documentation:**
    -   Authored a detailed guide in  explaining the step-by-step process for adding new MT5 accounts.
-   **Critical Bug Fix:**
    -   Implicitly resolved a critical VPS data-sync issue by identifying and correcting a misconfiguration ( name) in the MongoDB  collection for the new accounts.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Legacy FIDUS issue: Lucrum MT5 Bridge duplicate key errors:** This was noted in the initial handoff summary but was not addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Live Data Integration:** The agent debugged and mastered the data flow from the MT5 VPS bridge to MongoDB, understanding that the  collection acts as the source of truth for which accounts to sync.
-   **Dynamic Frontend Calculation:** The  component was built to perform real-time P&L and ROI calculations by combining live balance data from the API with a static  field stored in the database.
-   **System Documentation:** Documented a complex operational procedure () in  to ensure future scalability and reduce manual error.

**key DB schema**
-   **mt5_account_config:** The configuration collection for MT5 accounts.
    -   **Key columns:**  (Number),  (String),  (String, must be 'LucrumCapital-Trade'),  (Boolean),  (String, e.g., 'live_demo'),  (Number).
-   **mt5_accounts:** The collection containing live, synced data from the MT5 terminals (balance, equity, profit, etc.), which is populated by the VPS bridge script.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The file/component to be replaced. A new component should be created for the new dashboard.
-   : Contains existing API endpoints like  which will be used as the data source.
-   : Contains critical architecture documentation.

**key api endpoints**
-   : The primary existing endpoint that provides performance data for trading strategies. This will be the main data source for the new dashboard.
-   : A new endpoint created for the LIVE DEMO tab.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your primary and only task is to build the **Next-Generation Trading Analytics Dashboard** as per the user's detailed specifications.
-   **Start with Phases 1 & 2 only.** Do NOT build the AI Strategy Advisor tab.
-   The new dashboard must **replace** the existing Trading Analytics functionality.
-   Use **LIVE data** from existing backend APIs. Do not use hardcoded mock data for the final implementation.
-   Strictly follow the specified design direction: dark theme, specific colors,  for charts, and  for icons. The goal is an institutional-grade look and feel.
-   The previous critical issue regarding VPS data sync is **resolved**. The architecture for adding and syncing accounts is understood and documented. Do not revisit this unless a new, specific problem arises.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    was significantly updated with new documentation for adding MT5 accounts.
