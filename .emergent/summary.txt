The AI engineer's trajectory details a complex journey building the FIDUS investment platform. Initially, critical MT5 integration and Google OAuth issues were tackled. The focus then shifted to developing a just-in-time MT5 account allocation feature, which involved significant backend refactoring and the creation of new frontend components. A recurring theme has been frontend integration challenges, particularly with authentication state persistence and correctly identifying which UI components are rendered. Despite numerous fixes, including a React JSX error and backend routing issues, the main blocker remains the inability to properly display the  component, with a legacy modal persistently appearing. The AI engineer has been trapped in a loop of modifying the wrong files due to difficulty in identifying the active UI component, currently unable to locate the Create Client Investment modal in the codebase despite it appearing in screenshots.

<product_requirements>
The FIDUS platform is an investment management system for internal admin users, requiring secure user management (JWT, Google OAuth), a production-grade MongoDB Atlas database, and real-time financial data from MetaTrader5 (MT5). Recent enhancements focus on:
1.  **Multiple MT5 Account Mapping**: Support unlimited MT5 accounts per investment, ensuring total allocations match the investment amount, with exclusivity checks.
2.  **Investor Password Management**: Crucially, only accept MT5 Investor Passwords (read-only), *never* Trading Passwords, with prominent visual warnings.
3.  **MT5 Account Deallocation**: Admin-approved workflow with mandatory notes and audit trails.
4.  **Admin-Only MT5 Management**: Restrict creation, editing, and deallocation to admins, requiring mandatory notes for all changes.
5.  **Broker Account Structure**: Support OMNIBUS sub-accounts and future multi-broker integration.
6.  **Google OAuth Integration**: Secure login via JWT and OAuth 2.0 with Google Workspace for CRM functions (Gmail, Calendar, Drive).
**Current Implementation State:** The MT5 backend refactoring for just-in-time allocation is complete and tested. A client readiness system with an override mechanism has been implemented. Investment creation now includes interest/gains separation accounts and calculates incubation/contract dates. A basic Investment Detail View component has been created.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, Pydantic,  (async MongoDB).
-   **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas.
-   **Authentication**: JWT, Google OAuth 2.0,  for token.
-   **MT5 Integration**: FastAPI bridge on Windows VPS,  Python package.
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes ingress, Docker, Supervisor.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Main FastAPI app. Fixed route order for specific  paths and added client readiness override endpoints. Re-added  endpoint logic.
-   ****: Updated to include fields for , , and various date/status fields (e.g., , ).
-   ****: Main React app, fixed authentication token retrieval from  to .
-   ****: Refactored to be view-only by removing floating JSX form elements, resolving a compilation error.
-   ****: A new component for just-in-time MT5 allocation with UI for multiple accounts and date calculations. Its  endpoint was corrected, and a large visual marker was added for debugging.
-   ****: Intended to be the main investment tab; its  dependencies and loading state were adjusted. Its legacy modal content was replaced with .
-   ****: This component's Create Investment button was mistakenly identified as the entry point. Its internal modal content for investment creation was replaced with .
-   ****: Modified to include a KYC/AML override interface for testing client readiness.
-   ****: A new component created to display investment details, but currently unrouted and inaccessible.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Integration**: Correctly integrate  so it renders when creating an investment.
-   **Client Dropdown Fix**: Ensure the client dropdown in the investment creation form is populated.
-   **Investment Detail View Integration**: Add routing and navigation to .
-   **KYC/AML Document Upload Workflow**: Implement the full UI for document uploads.
-   **Google OAuth/Gmail API Integration**: Complete full Gmail API functionality beyond messages, and verify Calendar/Drive.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved resolving a persistent frontend issue: the Create Investment button consistently opens a legacy modal titled Create Client Investment instead of the developed  component. Despite multiple attempts to replace modal content in  and , fixing an authentication token mismatch in , and correcting the API endpoint called by , the correct component is still not rendering. Debugging logs from  (including a prominent visual marker) are not appearing in the console, confirming it's not mounted. The AI engineer is currently unable to locate the actual component responsible for rendering the Create Client Investment modal, as direct text searches for this title in the codebase yield no results, leading to a critical blocking issue for the frontend's usability.

<optional_next_step>
Search the codebase for Create Client Investment to identify the component rendering the legacy modal.
