The AI engineer's work began by fixing the MT5 Account Management System frontend, which was failing to load data. After confirming the backend API worked, the engineer addressed UI/UX issues, fixing hardcoded accounts in  and  and integrating account 891215 into . The  tab was removed, consolidating functionality.

A significant effort was then dedicated to resolving persistent MT5 bridge connectivity issues on the VPS, requiring multiple iterations: fixing  compatibility, specifying master password usage, enabling MT5 terminal settings (Algo Trading, DLL imports), running as administrator, and finally modifying  to connect to a running instance. This led to successfully syncing 5 out of 7 real accounts after database cleanup.

Following this, a major UI/UX overhaul was implemented across four phases using . This included adding Equity Curve, Win/Loss Donut, Portfolio Allocation Pie, and Money Manager Performance Bar charts. Global enhancements like loading skeletons, export functionality, and animations were also integrated.

The trajectory concludes with an urgent critical bug: a client's investment data disappeared. The AI engineer has identified the data corruption in MongoDB (client ID mismatch, zero amounts, wrong status) and successfully restored it, now proceeding to verify the fix.

The FIDUS platform requires a comprehensive investment management system featuring accurate MT5 data, precise cash flow, and robust client onboarding. The initial problem involved addressing inaccurate P&L. Key features already implemented include Automated Broker Rebates, Money Manager Performance Fees, real-time data integrity via VPS MT5 Bridge to MongoDB, technical documentation integration, client dashboard enhancements with detailed fund cards and an investment calculator, and a TradingHub Gold Provider link.

The core ongoing development is the **MT5 Account Management System**. This full-stack system allows administrators to add, edit, or remove MT5 accounts via an admin dashboard, making it 100% data-driven from the MT5 Python Bridge to MongoDB, eliminating manual VPS access for account configuration. This includes:
1.  **Backend API (FastAPI):** CRUD operations for  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ACTIVATE), API for  (live data), and a summary API.
2.  **Admin Dashboard (React):** An  page to list, add, edit, activate, and deactivate MT5 accounts, displaying live data and a summary dashboard.
3.  **Python Bridge Update:** The VPS script () reads accounts from , processes active accounts, and syncs live data to .

Recent enhancements include fixing display issues for all 7 active MT5 accounts across dashboards, integrating account 891215 into cash flow, removing redundant admin tabs, and a major UI/UX overhaul with 6 new charts (Equity Curve, Win/Loss Donut, Portfolio Allocation, Manager Performance, Revenue Sources, Monthly Trends), global loading skeletons, export functionality, and animations.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was investigating and fixing a critical bug reported by the user: client Alejandro Mariscal's investment data was missing/incorrect in the dashboard. The investigation involved directly querying the MongoDB database.

The AI engineer discovered that:
1.  Investments for Alejandro Mariscal were stored under a  of , but the user account itself had no  assigned, causing a mismatch.
2.  The  and  investments for Alejandro were incorrectly showing  instead of their initial amounts (8,151.41 for CORE and 00,000 for BALANCE).
3.  The status of these investments was  instead of .

The AI engineer has successfully executed a MongoDB command to restore this data, updating the  collection for Alejandro Mariscal with the correct , amounts, and  status. The next immediate step is to verify that these changes are correctly reflected in the client dashboard.
