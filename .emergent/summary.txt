The AI engineer's work evolved from initial bug fixes and UI/UX improvements to establishing a robust MT5 data sync system. After addressing data loading issues and a critical production database problem, the focus shifted to the MT5 Bridge Service. The engineer successfully implemented Phases 1-3: a VPS-based MT5 Bridge with encryption and auto-restart, a FastAPI backend for real-time data, and a React frontend consuming this data, removing all mock data.

The current phase, Phase 4A, involves enhancing data collection to include deal history, which is crucial for enabling several non-functional dashboards (Trading Analytics, Cash Flow, Broker Rebates, Money Manager Performance). The engineer successfully completed Days 1-2 (VPS script enhancement, MongoDB schema, backend API endpoints) and Day 3 (frontend integration for all relevant dashboards, including a new Broker Rebates component, and implementation of horizontal scrolling for UI tabs). The latest work, Day 4, focused on implementing a comprehensive GitHub Actions-driven CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments to Render (frontend/backend) and the VPS (MT5 bridge). The AI engineer has created all necessary code and documentation for this automation and is now providing instructions for the user to complete the final setup steps (GitHub Secrets and VPS configuration).

The FIDUS platform needs an investment management system with accurate MT5 data. Initially, the core problem was inaccurate P&L, addressed by automating Broker Rebates, Money Manager Performance Fees, and ensuring real-time data integrity from MT5 via a VPS Bridge to MongoDB. The MT5 Account Management System allows administrators to manage accounts through a data-driven dashboard, featuring a FastAPI backend for CRUD operations and a Python Bridge for syncing active accounts. Existing implementations include a UI/UX overhaul, displaying all 7 active MT5 accounts, and automatic 5-minute data flow with encrypted passwords.

Phase 4A aims to unlock advanced analytics by collecting deal history. This includes implementing , creating an  MongoDB collection (90-day backfill, daily incremental sync), and developing new backend API endpoints (, , , etc.). Frontend dashboards (Trading Analytics, Cash Flow, Broker Rebates, Money Manager Performance) require updates to consume this real data. A major recent requirement is to automate deployments through GitHub Actions for the frontend, backend, and VPS, eliminating manual intervention for updates.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Optional Enhancements (from user's initial request):** Equity Snapshots, Pending Orders, Terminal Status, Transfer Classification Detail, Account Growth Metrics, Sync Status & Error Logging, Broker Costs & Spreads.
-   **User-side tasks for GitHub Automation:**
    -   Add required GitHub Secrets (VPS credentials, Render deploy hook, Emergent webhook URL).
    -   Perform one-time VPS setup (Git installation, repository initialization, configuring auto-update Task Scheduler tasks).
    -   Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire CI/CD pipeline and dashboards.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the code implementation for Phase 4A and the GitHub automation.
**Phase 4A Completion:**
-   **VPS Bridge Script**:  (which will be  on VPS) was enhanced to collect and sync deal history.
-   **MongoDB Schema**: Designed for  collection.
-   **Backend API**: Six new endpoints were added to  and  for fetching deal history, summaries, rebates, and analytics.
-   **Frontend Integration**: All four previously non-functional dashboards (, , ) were updated to consume real data from the new Phase 4A backend APIs. A brand new  component was created. The  was modified to include horizontal scrolling for tabs and ensure all new tabs are accessible.

**GitHub Automation Implementation**:
-   **Workflow Files**: , , and  were created in .
-   **VPS Scripts**:  (PowerShell script for auto-pulling and service restart) and  (batch wrapper for update and running bridge) were created in the  directory.
-   **Documentation**:  and  were created to guide the user through setting up the VPS and understanding the CI/CD.

The system is now at 92% completion, with all code implemented. The remaining 8% constitutes user-side tasks to configure GitHub Secrets, perform a one-time setup on the VPS, and conduct final end-to-end testing. The engineer has created detailed step-by-step instructions for these user tasks.
