The AI engineer successfully enhanced the FIDUS financial portal, initially completing a Document Portal with mock DocuSign functionality (later upgraded to real Gmail API integration for sending documents). A major pivot then occurred with a large CRM system request. The engineer implemented core CRM features, including fund management with investor allocation, real-time dashboards (simulated MT4/MT5 data due to OS limitations), and role-based access. Frontend components for detailed investor views and client profiles were created. A significant amount of time was spent debugging login and document sending issues, which were eventually resolved. Most recently, the engineer addressed and integrated Gmail API for document handling, then implemented advanced Admin portal functionalities including clickable elements for detailed client/investor views and a MetaQuotes Data tab for (simulated) trading data. The current focus is on a persistent bug where the Gmail authentication button is not correctly connecting, despite backend API calls being successful.

The initial request was for a full-stack financial website with an animated FIDUS logo, dual Client/Admin login, and respective dashboards (Client: balance/transaction history; Admin: AUM, allocation, performance, data simulation, import/export). This expanded to include first-time user registration with real AML/KYC, Excel client management for admins, and a secure password reset system.

The most recent, comprehensive request is for a CRM system for FIDUS Solutions LLC, featuring:
- Client onboarding with digital KYC/AML.
- Investor allocation tracking across four funds (CORE, BALANCE, DYNAMIC, UNLIMITED).
- Automated capital flows (subscriptions, redemptions, distributions).
- Real-time AUM/NAV/performance dashboards.
- Role-based Investor/Manager portals.
- Secure document storage with DocuSign integration (later pivoted to Gmail for sending).
- Automated compliance reminders (FATCA, CRS, FSRC).
- Integration with banking/broker APIs (specifically MT4/MT5 monitoring).
- Multi-currency support.
- Communication tools (emails, investor updates).
- Exportable investor reports (PDF/Excel).
- Top-tier encryption, audit trails, and regulatory compliance.
- Integrations with accounting, n8n automations.

Recent explicit requests focused on:
- Completing the Document Portal.
- Fixing a backend send-for-signature endpoint design issue.
- Integrating a Gmail API for admin email sending and receiving, to be used with the Document Portal.
- Enhancing the Admin portal's CRM features: clickable investors in Fund Management for detailed views, clickable clients in Trading Monitor for profile details, clickable total clients in Client Management, and a MetaQuotes Data tab with login for MT4/MT5 integration.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the Gmail authentication button on the Document Portal; it currently displays Not Connected despite backend API calls working. The issue is likely with the frontend's handling of the OAuth flow or redirect.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in fixing a reported bug: the Authentication Gmail blue button on the document portal is not working does not connect (Chat Message 379). The engineer investigated this by:
1.  **Frontend Testing**: Took a screenshot (Chat Message 382) which showed the Gmail Settings panel visible, the Authenticate Gmail button, and successful network requests to  and  (both returning 200 status codes), indicating the OAuth flow was initiated, but the status remained Not Connected.
2.  **Backend Testing**: Ran backend tests (Chat Message 384) which confirmed that the Gmail OAuth backend was working perfectly, generating auth URLs and handling callbacks correctly.
3.  **Code Examination**: Examined  (Chat Message 386) to understand the frontend OAuth handling logic.
The engineer identified that the issue is likely within the frontend's handling of the OAuth redirect, specifically with the popup window approach not communicating back to the main window properly. The last action was an edit to  (Chat Message 390) to implement a more robust OAuth flow solution, followed by two more user confirmations of the persistent issue (Chat Message 391, 392). The current work is focused on resolving this persistent Gmail authentication problem.
