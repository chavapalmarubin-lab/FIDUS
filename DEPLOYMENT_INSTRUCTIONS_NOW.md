## 🔍 Current vs Fixed Values

## ✅ What Gets Fixed

1. **Cash Flow Tab**: Shows correct client money ($134,145.41)
2. **Fund Portfolio Tab**: Shows Zurya's investment included
3. **Money Managers Tab**: Shows equity instead of P&L
4. **Export to Excel**: Working properly
5. **All Calculations**: Dynamic from database (SSOT)

## 🎯 Why This Fixes It

**Problem**: Production Render has this OLD code:
```python
CLIENT_MONEY = 118151.41  # Hardcoded
```

**Solution**: My code dynamically calculates:
```python
active_investments = db.investments.find({'status': 'active'})
CLIENT_MONEY = sum(inv['principal_amount'] for inv in active_investments)
# Returns: 134145.41 ✅
```
