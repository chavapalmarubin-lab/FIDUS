## Technical Fixes Implemented

### **🔧 React Key Duplication Resolution**
**Root Cause**: LogoAnimation component had multiple `<motion.div>` elements without unique keys
**Files Fixed**: `/app/frontend/src/components/LogoAnimation.js`

**Before** (Causing React crashes):
```jsx
<motion.div className="financial-element">  // No key
<motion.div className="financial-element">  // No key
<motion.div className="financial-element">  // No key
```

**After** (Working perfectly):
```jsx
<motion.div key="candlestick-chart" className="financial-element">
<motion.div key="line-chart" className="financial-element">
<motion.div key="pie-chart" className="financial-element">
<motion.div key="network-diagram" className="financial-element">
<motion.div key="data-blocks" className="financial-element">
<motion.div key="fidus-logo" className="fidus-logo">
<motion.div key="pulsing-effect" style={{...}}>
```

### **📱 Animation Components Fixed**
- **Candlestick Chart**: `key="candlestick-chart"`
- **Line Chart**: `key="line-chart"`  
- **Pie Chart**: `key="pie-chart"`
- **Network Diagram**: `key="network-diagram"`
- **Data Blocks**: `key="data-blocks"`
- **FIDUS Logo**: `key="fidus-logo"`
- **Pulsing Effect**: `key="pulsing-effect"`
