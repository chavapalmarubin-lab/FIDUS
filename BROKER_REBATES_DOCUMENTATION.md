## üìä Rebate Calculation Logic

### Formula
```
Rebate Earned = Trading Volume (lots) √ó Rebate Rate (per lot)
```

### Example Calculation
```
Account: 8885089 (BALANCE Fund)
Broker: MEX-Atlantic
Period: October 1-13, 2025

Trading Volume: 57.7 lots
Rebate Rate: $5.05 per lot
Rebate Earned: 57.7 √ó $5.05 = $291.44
```

### Volume Calculation
The system queries MT5 trading history for all accounts linked to a broker during the specified period and sums the lot sizes of all closed trades.

### Automatic Approval
When `auto_approve: true` is set, the system automatically:
1. Calculates rebates from MT5 trading data
2. Creates rebate transactions
3. Sets verification_status to "verified"
4. Integrates with Cash Flow calculations

## üè¢ Adding New Brokers

### Step 1: Create Broker Configuration

Use the POST endpoint to add a new broker:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/config \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "broker_code": "ICM",
    "broker_name": "IC Markets",
    "rebate_per_lot": 4.50,
    "currency": "USD",
    "active": true
  }'
```

### Step 2: Update MT5 Accounts

Ensure MT5 accounts are properly configured:
1. Go to MT5 Accounts management
2. Assign accounts to the new broker
3. Verify broker_name field matches configuration
4. Ensure accounts are active and trading

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Verify broker was added
curl -X GET "https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/config" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Step 4: Test Calculation

Run a test calculation for the new broker:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/calculate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "end_date": "2025-10-13",
    "auto_approve": false
  }'
```

Review the results before approving.

## üìÖ Monthly Reconciliation Process

### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Rebates
At the end of each month, run the calculation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/calculate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "end_date": "2025-10-31",
    "auto_approve": false
  }'
```

### Step 2: Compare with Broker Statements
1. Download broker rebate statements
2. Compare total volume and rebate amounts
3. Investigate any discrepancies

### Step 3: Approve Transactions
For each verified transaction:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/transactions/{transaction_id}/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verification_status": "verified",
    "notes": "Confirmed with broker statement"
  }'
```

### Step 4: Mark as Paid
When broker pays rebates:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/transactions/{transaction_id}/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payment_status": "paid",
    "notes": "Payment received on 2025-11-05"
  }'
```

### Step 5: Generate Reports
Use the summary endpoint to generate monthly reports:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-backend-url/api/admin/rebates/summary?month=10&year=2025" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Rebates showing $0
- **Cause**: No trading volume in the specified period
- **Solution**: Verify MT5 accounts have closed trades in the date range

**Issue**: Broker not found
- **Cause**: Broker configuration missing
- **Solution**: Add broker using POST /api/admin/rebates/config

**Issue**: Volume mismatch with broker statement
- **Cause**: Different calculation period or closed trades only
- **Solution**: Verify date ranges match and only closed trades are counted

**Issue**: Transaction not appearing in Cash Flow
- **Cause**: Transaction not verified
- **Solution**: Update verification_status to "verified"

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging in backend:
```python
logging.info(f"üí∞ Broker Rebates: ${broker_rebates:,.2f} from {total_volume} lots")
```
