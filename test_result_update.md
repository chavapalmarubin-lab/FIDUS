          comment: "üö® ALEJANDRO MARISCAL PRODUCTION VERIFICATION COMPLETED - COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC REVEALS CRITICAL ISSUES! Conducted detailed endpoint testing and database analysis as requested in urgent review. CURRENT STATE vs EXPECTED STATE: (1) ‚úÖ READY-FOR-INVESTMENT ENDPOINT WORKING: Returns Alejandro correctly but with WRONG EMAIL - Database has 'alejandro.mariscal@email.com' but review expects 'alexmar7609@gmail.com'. (2) ‚ùå INVESTMENT DATA MISMATCH: Found 5 investments totaling $148,151.41 instead of expected 2 investments totaling $118,151.41. Breakdown: BALANCE $100,000 ‚úÖ (correct), CORE $48,151.41 ‚ùå (expected $18,151.41). Extra investments: 3 additional CORE investments of $10,000 each. (3) ‚ùå MT5 ACCOUNTS COMPLETELY MISSING: Found 0 MT5 accounts instead of expected 4 accounts (886557 $80k, 886066 $10k, 886602 $10k, 885822 $18,151.41) with MEXAtlantic broker. (4) ‚ùå ADMIN OVERVIEW CALCULATION ERROR: Shows $0.00 AUM and 0 investments despite 5 investments existing in database totaling $148,151.41. TECHNICAL EVIDENCE: All endpoints return HTTP 200 and are functional, but data doesn't match production requirements. Database contains client_alejandro with investment_ready=true, but production setup is incomplete. URGENT FIXES REQUIRED: (1) Update email from 'alejandro.mariscal@email.com' to 'alexmar7609@gmail.com', (2) Clean up investments to exactly 2: BALANCE ($100,000) + CORE ($18,151.41), (3) Create 4 MT5 accounts with MEXAtlantic broker and specified account numbers/balances, (4) Fix admin overview calculation to reflect actual investment data. CONCLUSION: Production setup is 20% complete (1/5 tests passed). System is functional but data setup doesn't match review requirements. NOT READY FOR GO-LIVE until data corrections are implemented."
